07/07/2022, 15:58 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
08/07/2022, 07:50 - Lieke: Do I have to get a bandana to be in the ninja team 🤪
08/07/2022, 10:01 - Tim U.: Well it's not a team comp :p
08/07/2022, 10:03 - Lieke: Next teamcomp we'll be a ninja team then :p
08/07/2022, 10:13 - Tim U.: Got enough headbands for everyone
08/07/2022, 10:32 - Lieke: Oehhh 👀
08/07/2022, 11:13 - Sanne: You can just imagine it's a team comp and then leech of each other's success
08/07/2022, 11:14 - Sanne: My neighbour thinks we should do a competition in Sweden
08/07/2022, 11:19 - Tim U.: Flying in my Dutch pros to screw the local competition xD
08/07/2022, 11:42 - Sanne: Exactly
08/07/2022, 11:43 - Sanne: I can probably convince them I'm Swedish
08/07/2022, 11:44 - Sanne: I'll just mumble and talk about rødbrød a lot and they'll assume I'm from somewhere close to the Danish border
08/07/2022, 18:55 - Sanne: I am pretty sure that I will probably come and watch tomorrow
08/07/2022, 18:55 - Lieke: Oehh niceee
09/07/2022, 12:55 - Lieke: Is Sanne late again? 🤪
14/07/2022, 10:17 - Tim U.: Tomorrow I have a work meeting from 16-17 so I'll join an hour later than usual
14/07/2022, 11:26 - Lieke: Aight then I'll also come a bit later probably
14/07/2022, 11:42 - Sanne: So did you peeps want to play wingspan after?
14/07/2022, 11:42 - Sanne: And if so, what type of cake would you like?
14/07/2022, 11:43 - Tim U.: I still need to check with girlfriend
15/07/2022, 00:40 - Tim U.: I'd rather skip wingspan tomorrow, it's the last evening before girlfriend goes on 3 weeks vacation (and returns 4 days before I go to Sweden)
15/07/2022, 11:22 - Sanne: Ah yeah that makes sense, enjoy your evening together ✨
15/07/2022, 12:26 - Sanne: We can also do Sunday?
15/07/2022, 12:26 - Tim U.: Got no plans then
15/07/2022, 12:36 - Lieke: What would work better for you in the afternoon or evening? I have to be in Arnhem at 16:00
15/07/2022, 13:11 - Tim U.: Well I'll go at 2 anyway with Lukas and could go again starting from 17:30
15/07/2022, 13:12 - Tim U.: *2=14
15/07/2022, 13:40 - Lieke: We could do Wingspan in the evening then
15/07/2022, 13:41 - Lieke: Im getting piercings in the afternoon so I won't climbing on Sunday😂🙈
15/07/2022, 13:46 - Sanne: The evening suits me :)
15/07/2022, 13:47 - Sanne: Just can't make it too late bc on monday I need to be on a train at 7:13
15/07/2022, 13:48 - Lieke: I have too work the day after as well so I won't make it late 😘
15/07/2022, 13:49 - Tim U.: Luckily our wingspan evenings rarely get late
15/07/2022, 13:51 - Sanne: Yeah I dunno why I said that
15/07/2022, 13:51 - Sanne: We are the most responsible people I know
15/07/2022, 13:51 - Sanne: Always home before dark
15/07/2022, 13:53 - Tim U.: Heh
15/07/2022, 16:28 - Tim U.: My meeting is done now, Lieke when would you be there?
15/07/2022, 16:29 - Lieke: I can change and be there in like 20 min ish?
15/07/2022, 16:29 - Tim U.: Fits
15/07/2022, 16:29 - Lieke: Aight :)
17/07/2022, 18:24 - Lieke: What time are we gonna meet up?
17/07/2022, 18:31 - Sanne: At about 20?
17/07/2022, 18:32 - Sanne: So after dinner
17/07/2022, 18:33 - Sanne: My place okay?
17/07/2022, 18:34 - Tim U.: Yes
17/07/2022, 18:34 - Lieke: Aight then I'll fix some food :)
17/07/2022, 18:35 - Lieke: For dinner
17/07/2022, 18:35 - Lieke: I mean I do have some oreos left I could bring 😂
17/07/2022, 18:35 - Sanne: Haha it's fine
17/07/2022, 18:35 - Sanne: You do you
17/07/2022, 19:27 - Sanne: Uh so time is a suggestion right?
17/07/2022, 19:30 - Tim U.: What's the new suggestion?
17/07/2022, 19:33 - Sanne: Haha it's just somehing between 20 and 20:30
17/07/2022, 19:35 - Sanne: If you manage 20 you can be here to judge me while I am still watering plants or struggling with ebooks
19/07/2022, 13:24 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
19/07/2022, 13:27 - Tim U.: Uh they're onto you

20/07/2022, 17:12 - Tim U.: Y'all wanna do some outdoor slab climbing?
21/07/2022, 00:13 - Sanne: He looks comfy
21/07/2022, 00:13 - Sanne: Taking a nice break
23/07/2022, 14:30 - Sanne: Look what I found:
23/07/2022, 14:30 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
23/07/2022, 14:31 - Sanne: They're called blue-footed boobies 😂
23/07/2022, 14:31 - Sanne: First tits and now these, it's a beautiful world out there
23/07/2022, 16:08 - Lieke: 😂😂
07/08/2022, 10:38 - Tim U.: So my mum hasn't told me yet when she'd be here because she was on a wedding party yesterday. Not sure if bouldering at noon might actually be better now 😅
07/08/2022, 11:36 - Tim U.: Update, she'll be here at 1:30, so I'll probably have time around 3 or 4
07/08/2022, 11:41 - Sanne: Okido that's nice
07/08/2022, 11:41 - Sanne: Then I can put some attention in Lex 😅
07/08/2022, 12:42 - Lieke: Aight nicee :)
07/08/2022, 15:06 - Lieke: Me and Bart are already here
07/08/2022, 15:18 - Tim U.: I'll join around 4
07/08/2022, 16:05 - Sanne: Uh I'll come at one point
07/08/2022, 16:06 - Sanne: Bf and I just had the actual underlying fight and it was really productive
07/08/2022, 16:07 - Sanne: I will sugar up and come for some hugs later 🥰
07/08/2022, 16:50 - Sanne: Omw
07/08/2022, 20:16 - Tim U.: I feel like I could have said a bit more during our therapy session so here's some 'quiet German boi tries to express emotion'
07/08/2022, 20:17 - Tim U.: I feel honored that you opened up so much to me and think (now more than before already) that you both just turned out great. It's been a joy to get to know you and I'll sure miss my little girls while I'm away 🤗 (can't tell if that line sounds terrible or not) 
Keep doing what you do cause as far as I can tell you're doing awesome 🙃
07/08/2022, 21:36 - Lieke: Nahww Tim don't be so sweet that's just gonna make us miss you even more 🥺
07/08/2022, 21:37 - Tim U.: I was strongly tempted to delete it and replace it with something much more bland, shows how much I'll need to improve on this 🙈
07/08/2022, 21:38 - Lieke: Nooo I'm glad you kept it
07/08/2022, 21:38 - Lieke: You're a really sweet boy ❤️❤️
07/08/2022, 21:38 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
07/08/2022, 22:17 - Sanne: Ahw honey
07/08/2022, 22:18 - Sanne: No yes I was very 🥰 reading this
07/08/2022, 22:19 - Sanne: Just a bit too preoccupied with hugs to respond sooner
07/08/2022, 22:19 - Sanne: I liked that you called us your girls haha
07/08/2022, 22:19 - Sanne: You're a sweetie ❤️
07/08/2022, 22:27 - Tim U.: If you can call me daddy/brother I can do that ;p
07/08/2022, 22:30 - Lieke: Hahah I'll accept it
07/08/2022, 22:30 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
07/08/2022, 22:32 - Tim U.: I think you also said papa at some point, I can't decide which one makes me squirm more 😅

07/08/2022, 22:51 - Tim U.: Intense

11/08/2022, 09:48 - Lieke: Good luck with your flight 😘❤️
11/08/2022, 09:51 - Tim U.: Just arrived in Stockholm, now I'll wait 5h for the 2nd flight
11/08/2022, 10:08 - Sanne: Look at you, being launched into your future
11/08/2022, 10:08 - Sanne: Enough time to go bouldering I would say ;)
11/08/2022, 10:30 - Tim U.: Heh, it's 30min to actual Stockholm so that's probably all a bit too long
11/08/2022, 10:54 - Lieke: Hahaha I mean 5 hours is a lot of time
11/08/2022, 10:56 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
11/08/2022, 10:59 - Sanne: Ooh that looks comfy
11/08/2022, 11:01 - Lieke: Oehh yeahs that looks nice
11/08/2022, 18:03 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
11/08/2022, 18:10 - Sanne: Pretty ✨
11/08/2022, 18:10 - Sanne: Fuck yeah, clouds 🥰
11/08/2022, 18:29 - Lieke: Oehh prettyyy
11/08/2022, 21:27 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
11/08/2022, 22:28 - Sanne: Hmm quite nice
11/08/2022, 22:29 - Sanne: Will you get the northern lights in the winter?
11/08/2022, 22:29 - Tim U.: Supposedly yes, rather excited about those
11/08/2022, 22:37 - Sanne: Ooh
11/08/2022, 22:38 - Sanne: Another reason to visit you in winter
11/08/2022, 23:25 - Lieke: Oehhh looks nicee
12/08/2022, 11:43 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
12/08/2022, 12:01 - Sanne: Do you pay for electricity?
12/08/2022, 12:02 - Sanne: If you get an ov card, you can go in circles and charge your phone for free
12/08/2022, 12:06 - Tim U.: I got a 30 day ticket now so I guess I could do that
12/08/2022, 22:08 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>

12/08/2022, 22:28 - Sanne: His is exactly how I picture Sweden, lol
12/08/2022, 22:29 - Sanne: Bikes!
12/08/2022, 22:29 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
12/08/2022, 22:30 - Sanne: I showed it to bf without context to make him guess and he was like "Zweden"
12/08/2022, 22:30 - Sanne: It's confirmed
12/08/2022, 22:31 - Sanne: Looks many nice :)
13/08/2022, 00:03 - Lieke: Oehhh is such a cute vibe
13/08/2022, 14:10 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
13/08/2022, 14:10 - Lieke: 😂😂😂
13/08/2022, 18:29 - Sanne: 😂+extra giggle from Dennis
13/08/2022, 20:57 - Tim U.: For our potential gaming hangouts, here are some preliminary suggestions:
- Stardew Valley
- Terraria
- Overcooked (1/2)
- Castle Crashers
- Ultimate Chicken Horse
- Wingspan (steam)
14/08/2022, 01:42 - Lieke: Stardew is lit
14/08/2022, 01:44 - Tim U.: Wingspan aside, I think it might be the most palatable one for Sanne from my list
14/08/2022, 01:46 - Lieke: And you can date the villagers which is funny
14/08/2022, 01:46 - Tim U.: I've heard that some people even play it primarily for that
14/08/2022, 01:49 - Sanne: Haha that sounds like me
14/08/2022, 01:49 - Sanne: Haven't heard of it actually
14/08/2022, 01:49 - Sanne: I am all for wingspan of course
14/08/2022, 01:50 - Sanne: And Castle Crashers would be lots of nostalgia ❤️
14/08/2022, 01:50 - Tim U.: Oh you know that one? 👀
14/08/2022, 01:50 - Sanne: It is one of the few games I was ever really into
14/08/2022, 01:51 - Tim U.: Dang now I feel like we need to play it to see how good you are
14/08/2022, 01:51 - Sanne: Yeah we played with the siblings a lot
14/08/2022, 01:51 - Sanne: It allowed for lots of spanning so it was allright that I sucked at gaming 😅
14/08/2022, 01:52 - Sanne: We played on the xbox though so I might be really lost if I play it on something else
14/08/2022, 01:53 - Sanne: Spamming I mean. Guess I had birds on my mind still
14/08/2022, 01:54 - Tim U.: Fair fair
14/08/2022, 12:17 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
14/08/2022, 12:17 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
14/08/2022, 12:38 - Sanne: Yeah I think you fit in there
14/08/2022, 12:38 - Sanne: Is it wet too?
14/08/2022, 12:40 - Sanne: Pretty ✨
14/08/2022, 12:40 - Sanne: Is this close to where you live?
14/08/2022, 12:41 - Tim U.: It's around city centre, which 15min by bus / 25min by bike from my place
14/08/2022, 12:42 - Tim U.: Not sure, didn't touch it
14/08/2022, 12:43 - Sanne: Oh that sounds like a good distance in case you need to go dramatically stare at some water
14/08/2022, 12:45 - Sanne: You gotta check these things. Stay ahead of culture surpises
14/08/2022, 12:46 - Sanne: What if someone invites you to go swim in a lake and it turns out it's not wet and they all think it's super weird that you brought a towel
14/08/2022, 12:54 - Lieke: 😂😂
14/08/2022, 12:55 - Lieke: Looks really pretty, a good place to be when the weather is nice :)
15/08/2022, 15:37 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
15/08/2022, 15:37 - Sanne: For the bambini
15/08/2022, 21:25 - Sanne: We tried to take a bus today and then it said no 😅 and then our friend had a headache and then we went to the vegan restaurant across the street instead and they had colourful buns 🥰
15/08/2022, 21:25 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
15/08/2022, 21:27 - Sanne: How is veganism and dietry restrictions going in Sweden?
15/08/2022, 22:06 - Tim U.: Sounds like a fairly happy ending
15/08/2022, 22:06 - Tim U.: Food looks good too
15/08/2022, 22:12 - Tim U.: Stuff is available albeit expensive
15/08/2022, 22:30 - Lieke: Yeahss it was really nice. The colors made it more tasty imo 😂
15/08/2022, 22:59 - Sanne: Sounds like Sweden allright
15/08/2022, 23:24 - Tim U.: As they should 😋
16/08/2022, 19:00 - Sanne: We went to "Juliet’s House" bc there's a statue of her and you can grab her boob and that will bring you luck in love. And the prices were listed and it said something like regular was 6 euro and with 7 it included "Juliet’s Grab" so Lieke was like damn you pay one euro to grab her boob? She's a cheap hoe. It was in German 😂 so we can see her tomb also, that's more my speed. Can't wait to find out which indiscretions are part of the ritual there.
16/08/2022, 19:01 - Tim U.: Boob-grabbing dead people, I see you spared no exotic experiences
16/08/2022, 19:03 - Sanne: Well that was just the statue but I can only assume the tomb also includes boob grabbing
16/08/2022, 19:24 - Lieke: Hahahah that boob has been grabbed a thousand times before so it was nothing special 😂
17/08/2022, 15:46 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
17/08/2022, 15:58 - Sanne: We were trying to decide what you looked like and we concluded that it is a historical picture of someone who tried to steal the handbag of Leonardo di Cabrio 😂🚗
17/08/2022, 15:58 - Sanne: We're high on coffee
17/08/2022, 15:59 - Tim U.: You seem to be ingesting all kinds of substances lately :p
17/08/2022, 15:59 - Sanne: It's an okay picture. You look friendly
17/08/2022, 15:59 - Sanne: Tja, when in Rome..
17/08/2022, 15:59 - Tim U.: Certainly better than my old ID, that one looks like a wanted notice
17/08/2022, 16:00 - Sanne: Haha it's only going up from here
17/08/2022, 16:01 - Sanne: We found a desinterested Jesus today
17/08/2022, 16:01 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
17/08/2022, 16:01 - Sanne: He's like 🤷‍♀️ what am I to do about this
17/08/2022, 16:05 - Tim U.: "That kinda sounds like your problem"
17/08/2022, 16:07 - Sanne: This is why Jesus never answers your prayers 😂
17/08/2022, 16:07 - Sanne: He's like you won't wanna hear it
17/08/2022, 16:08 - Tim U.: If you stay on the prayer hotline long enough it'll eventually say "have you considered being less of a prick" and then hang up
17/08/2022, 16:12 - Sanne: 😂
17/08/2022, 16:13 - Sanne: "We are quite busy at the moment. Perhaps you can try buddhism"
17/08/2022, 16:14 - Tim U.: Buddhism is basically the self-checkout alternative
17/08/2022, 16:14 - Tim U.: But no one can tell you how to use the interface
17/08/2022, 16:15 - Sanne: 😂😂
17/08/2022, 16:16 - Sanne: We tried self check out here and we could press English but then we could an error message that was only in Italian 😅
17/08/2022, 16:17 - Tim U.: I met a German girl in queue earlier that was slightly overwhelmed with the portable barcode scanners at the local coop. Thought she could mindblow another German but I'm too damn international 😎
17/08/2022, 16:31 - Sanne: Nice haha
17/08/2022, 17:26 - Lieke: 🤭😂
18/08/2022, 10:46 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
18/08/2022, 10:48 - Tim U.: Don't let go!
18/08/2022, 11:38 - Lieke: It's a 6B+ at least
18/08/2022, 14:34 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
18/08/2022, 14:46 - Lieke: Damn niceee
18/08/2022, 14:46 - Lieke: We're also going bouldering Tonight 🥳
18/08/2022, 14:50 - Sanne: Ooh looks good!
18/08/2022, 15:00 - Tim U.: I was super confused about the difficulties not making sense at all but turns out the colours of the tape are important, not the holds 😅
18/08/2022, 16:12 - Sanne: Oof they get minus points for that, don't like that system
18/08/2022, 16:12 - Sanne: Maybe you can ignore the tape and you'll go at everything without prejudice and you'll just climb all the 7As
18/08/2022, 16:13 - Tim U.: That was me in the first 30min being confused why this 3 was just as hard as that 6a
18/08/2022, 16:26 - Lieke: Hahaha yeah I get you. I had the same when I went to Arnhem boulderhall for the first time
18/08/2022, 16:33 - Sanne: Embrace the chaos! At least there's no pressure that you feel like you have to be abe to do them 😅
18/08/2022, 16:44 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
18/08/2022, 16:47 - Sanne: Is that a sauna? 😂
18/08/2022, 16:50 - Tim U.: Of course
18/08/2022, 16:54 - Sanne: God damn it Sweden 😂😂
18/08/2022, 16:54 - Sanne: Who would want to go to a sauna after bouldering?
18/08/2022, 16:56 - Tim U.: I guess it could be nice in winter? Boulder, shower, sauna, food?
18/08/2022, 16:57 - Sanne: But then the saunas are also gendered right?
18/08/2022, 16:58 - Tim U.: Yeh they are attached to the gendered changing rooms
18/08/2022, 17:00 - Sanne: So then if you go with someone of not the same gender then you have to somehow telepathically communicate when you want to get out
18/08/2022, 17:00 - Sanne: Seems complex
18/08/2022, 17:00 - Sanne: In general I prefer to be with people I know compared to people of the same gender
18/08/2022, 17:00 - Sanne: But society doesn't agree
18/08/2022, 17:00 - Tim U.: I feel like Lex also might not 😅
18/08/2022, 17:01 - Sanne: Haha I mean in general
18/08/2022, 17:01 - Sanne: We had a mixed gender sauna session with friends
18/08/2022, 17:01 - Sanne: But yeah we know how that ended 😂 there was some actual relationship switch happening
18/08/2022, 17:02 - Tim U.: Clearly risky business
18/08/2022, 20:45 - Lieke: In the sauna you get sweaty and you can accidently slide into someones relationship😂
26/08/2022, 14:04 - Tim U.: When are you two coming back from vacation? I might manage to get my new PC up and running for the games 👀
26/08/2022, 15:05 - Lieke: We are back already but im going to Germany for 4 days Tomorrow so I'll be back the 30th :)
26/08/2022, 15:06 - Tim U.: That's good because steam doesn't like my old laptop running Linux 😅
26/08/2022, 15:06 - Tim U.: Did we decide on a game yet btw?
26/08/2022, 15:07 - Lieke: Hmm not yet I think but im up for anything
26/08/2022, 15:18 - Sanne: I think we should trial run all the ones we are excited about ☺️
26/08/2022, 15:18 - Tim U.: Ah maximising the initial cost, sneaky
26/08/2022, 15:19 - Tim U.: (good point tho)
26/08/2022, 15:19 - Sanne: Hahaha that sounds like me
26/08/2022, 15:20 - Sanne: Maybe we should all make presentation on which game(s) we want to play and why
26/08/2022, 15:20 - Sanne: Anyways, I'm off bouldering 💪🏻
26/08/2022, 15:24 - Tim U.: I haven't actually played most of the games on the list so I couldn't tell you much
26/08/2022, 15:25 - Tim U.: You go up there 💪🏻
26/08/2022, 16:10 - Sanne: Same 😅
26/08/2022, 16:11 - Sanne: Based on my experience I vote castle crashers (but secretly wingspan but then Lieke would have to want to invest)
26/08/2022, 16:12 - Sanne: Green is new and I miss you :( now I have to make a fool of myself by myself
26/08/2022, 16:49 - Tim U.: I think wingspan on steam can be played with free guests 🤔
26/08/2022, 16:50 - Tim U.: Awh, go get 'em
26/08/2022, 17:35 - Sanne: Ooh we can try that then
26/08/2022, 17:36 - Sanne: I did one with only 1 extra! Wanted it to be zero but that was a piston squat I was not ready for. I bet you could have done it though
27/08/2022, 12:16 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
27/08/2022, 12:20 - Sanne: It is known 😅
31/08/2022, 15:28 - Lieke: I keep forgetting to send the Boulder video of Italy
31/08/2022, 15:28 - Lieke: But now I remembered😂😂
31/08/2022, 15:30 - Tim U.: 👀
31/08/2022, 15:32 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
31/08/2022, 15:32 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
31/08/2022, 15:32 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
31/08/2022, 15:32 - Tim U.: Uh 6b+ look at you go 💪🏻
31/08/2022, 17:43 - Lieke: Yeahssss🥳
01/09/2022, 02:12 - Tim U.: Btw do any of you already own Terraria? If not, we could save some monies by buying the 4-pack🤔
01/09/2022, 02:47 - Lieke: I already own it but Sanne doesnt I think
01/09/2022, 02:48 - Tim U.: The 4 pack is 27€ so it's not worth it for 2 people then
01/09/2022, 02:49 - Lieke: Ahh sad, the 1 pack is also not really expensive right?
01/09/2022, 02:57 - Tim U.: No it's 10€
01/09/2022, 02:57 - Tim U.: Would have saved 1€ with the 4 pack 😅
01/09/2022, 02:57 - Tim U.: *with 3 people
01/09/2022, 02:58 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
01/09/2022, 03:10 - Lieke: Ahh a very dutch way of thinking, I love it 😂
01/09/2022, 03:10 - Lieke: Oehh niceee
01/09/2022, 08:56 - Sanne: Ooh looks cozy
01/09/2022, 08:57 - Sanne: Wow we assume I don't own games?
01/09/2022, 08:57 - Sanne: No don't have it :)
01/09/2022, 08:59 - Sanne: I spent yesterday trying to convince Dennis that my 3 games in steam made me a gamer gurl 😅
01/09/2022, 09:02 - Sanne: I was bullshitting about how the stalker function in Discord would cause people to think I'm cool bc I was 'gaming' and it actually worked cause my brother messaged me about it 🙈
01/09/2022, 09:05 - Sanne: Is tomorrow today now btw?
01/09/2022, 09:08 - Sanne: Don't have anything in the afternoon but might have a human over tonight though, not sure yet. Otherwise any of the other nights this weekend, not going anywhere really
01/09/2022, 09:33 - Sanne: Oh nvm, also no plans tonight
01/09/2022, 09:47 - Tim U.: I meant today, yes. I should be available around 13
01/09/2022, 10:54 - Lieke: I know you 😂
01/09/2022, 10:55 - Lieke: Hahahaha
01/09/2022, 10:55 - Lieke: I still have to travel to nijmegen, but I can also hang on discord while traveling
01/09/2022, 11:53 - Sanne: For me after is also fine. What time do you arrive?
01/09/2022, 12:23 - Lieke: I had to help dad in the backyard so I go after lunch which we do now
01/09/2022, 12:48 - Sanne: I need to shower still so it will be a while for me too 🙈
01/09/2022, 12:50 - Tim U.: I'll dry up from cycling through the rain then
01/09/2022, 12:54 - Sanne: Yeah no rush 😅
01/09/2022, 12:54 - Sanne: Ahw sounds like the Netherlands 🌈
01/09/2022, 13:17 - Lieke: Just let me know when everyones ready :)
01/09/2022, 13:39 - Sanne: I'm ready in 10 min orso
01/09/2022, 13:44 - Tim U.: Ready anytime
01/09/2022, 13:59 - Sanne: Ok so I lied, I'm ready now 😅
02/09/2022, 09:56 - Sanne: So Lieke and I have not started poledancing together yet but it seems highly likely that this is our new forever hobby so I started convincing Lex that we need a pole in the house and he does not see it!
02/09/2022, 09:57 - Sanne: He thinks the below neighbours will not like it but excuse me, where is the faith in my poledance skills?
02/09/2022, 09:58 - Sanne: And it has all sorts of benefits, like hot girls poledancing in the house (admittedly, it will probs just me and Lieke and whatever friend is weak enough to be manipulated by me)
02/09/2022, 10:04 - Tim U.: Good to hear you like it
02/09/2022, 10:05 - Tim U.: But careful, it's a bit like buying weights when you like going to the gym. Might not have the same motivation at home
02/09/2022, 10:06 - Sanne: Yeah I've been not buying one for years cause I'm scared of that
02/09/2022, 10:06 - Sanne: But I wanted one before I tried poledancing even once 😅
02/09/2022, 10:06 - Sanne: Think it's good furniture
02/09/2022, 10:20 - Lieke: Hahaha Kirsten will for sure
02/09/2022, 10:20 - Lieke: Is the way our brain works, already had the shoes before I went climbing once😂
02/09/2022, 10:30 - Sanne: Exactly, that's who I was thinking of
02/09/2022, 10:30 - Sanne: Mhm we have mild precognitive abilities, for sure
02/09/2022, 10:40 - Lieke: Hahahaha we know
02/09/2022, 10:40 - Lieke: Part of the fun 🫶🏻
02/09/2022, 12:34 - Tim U.: I was a bit low energy in our session yesterday due to short sleep but now I'm rather excited to get back to stardew 👀
02/09/2022, 12:39 - Lieke: Yeahhh im also excited to dive into the game and figure everything out☺️
02/09/2022, 12:45 - Tim U.: Maybe some more tonight?
02/09/2022, 12:49 - Sanne: Myeah I was also pretty low energy but Lieke made up for it by being her usual self 😘
02/09/2022, 12:52 - Sanne: I'll have to see about tonight, still feeling pretty low. Bouldering might help or be a little much by itself 😅
02/09/2022, 12:53 - Tim U.: Okay, let us/me know 🙃
02/09/2022, 14:42 - Lieke: Heheh im always hyped and then I didn't even know about my evening plans of going to utrecht at like 22:30 😂😂
02/09/2022, 14:43 - Lieke: Im going out tonight at 23:00 but before that I can definitely play some stardew ☺️
02/09/2022, 14:44 - Tim U.: Nice nice
02/09/2022, 19:34 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
02/09/2022, 19:34 - Lieke: Im taller than Sanne 🤪
02/09/2022, 19:35 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
02/09/2022, 19:35 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
02/09/2022, 19:44 - Tim U.: I like how lieke's video is short, crisp dynamic action and Sanne has over a minute of weird knee technique xD
02/09/2022, 19:46 - Sanne: You can't rush art ✨
02/09/2022, 19:47 - Sanne: We are still at the hall btw so maybe tomorrow is better
02/09/2022, 19:47 - Sanne: Otherwise Lieke can only do an hour or so
02/09/2022, 19:47 - Lieke: I still have to do groceries, shower and make dinner 😂🙈
02/09/2022, 19:48 - Lieke: But then tomorrow we can do even more stardew! 😏
02/09/2022, 19:48 - Tim U.: Okay ^^
03/09/2022, 12:48 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
03/09/2022, 12:48 - Sanne: 🥲
03/09/2022, 15:04 - Tim U.: Uh that's German
03/09/2022, 15:12 - Tim U.: Do you two have any time window in mind for playing today?
03/09/2022, 15:13 - Sanne: Haha doesn't this joke make you cringe completely?
03/09/2022, 15:13 - Sanne: Hmm I have no bed time ✨ as when to begin.. like 20 or 21?
03/09/2022, 15:15 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
03/09/2022, 15:20 - Tim U.: I'm used to that level in such places 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/09/2022, 15:20 - Tim U.: Looks nice
03/09/2022, 15:27 - Sanne: Mhm feels nice
03/09/2022, 15:27 - Sanne: Ah yeah, you learned to deal
03/09/2022, 17:12 - Lieke: Yeah around that time is fine, maybe 20 is better. There is a chance that im going to an drum&bass thing thats around 23/midnight 😂😂
03/09/2022, 17:17 - Sanne: Damn it Lieke
03/09/2022, 17:17 - Sanne: You party so much 😅
03/09/2022, 17:22 - Lieke: Is the last weekend before work calls again 🙈😂
03/09/2022, 18:01 - Sanne: Mhm I understand
03/09/2022, 18:01 - Sanne: Lex says to be careful with the drugs
03/09/2022, 18:02 - Lieke: I only had beer Yesterday so no worries 🫶🏻
03/09/2022, 18:03 - Lieke: And maybe today like no alcohol cause two days in a row can be too much most  the times haha 😅
03/09/2022, 18:04 - Sanne: Yeah that sounds smart
03/09/2022, 18:04 - Sanne: He was just being prejudiced about drum&bass lol
03/09/2022, 18:27 - Lieke: Ah yeah I get that. It's at doornroosje so I don't think it will be a big drugs thing 😂😂
03/09/2022, 19:27 - Sanne: Myeah it's not Amsterdam at least, but you'll probably see some
03/09/2022, 19:28 - Sanne: Btw, I'll be more like 20:30, I need to listen to Lex his album
04/09/2022, 17:22 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
04/09/2022, 18:08 - Sanne: Cool!
04/09/2022, 18:08 - Sanne: You _are_ the dangerpus wildlife
04/09/2022, 18:08 - Sanne: 😂😂danger pus
05/09/2022, 12:40 - Sanne: Oh btw, sister and I thought maybe tomorrow stardew after our poledancing debut?
05/09/2022, 12:46 - Tim U.: Tbh, I'd be up almost every evening so just let me know 🙃
05/09/2022, 12:52 - Lieke: Yesssss
05/09/2022, 15:57 - Lieke: I downloaded my Tinder date for funsies and my best and worst conversation starters are something😂
05/09/2022, 15:57 - Lieke: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/515631822319910922/1016323267423895665/unknown.png
05/09/2022, 15:58 - Lieke: The "sorry hiervoor" is something I said before a bad pickup line was send
05/09/2022, 16:05 - Sanne: 😂
05/09/2022, 16:06 - Sanne: "Sorry hiervoor" is in any context the greatest way to introduce yourself
05/09/2022, 16:07 - Sanne: Can't believe that "hey" doesn't work. Seems okay 🤷‍♀️
05/09/2022, 16:07 - Lieke: Goeieavond is more mysterious apparently
05/09/2022, 16:07 - Sanne: What's the bit about "I know something had changed"?
05/09/2022, 16:07 - Lieke: It's high school musical lyric 😂
05/09/2022, 16:07 - Sanne: Evenings are spicy
05/09/2022, 16:07 - Sanne: Oooh noooo
05/09/2022, 16:08 - Sanne: Why does that work?
05/09/2022, 16:08 - Lieke: Yesss
05/09/2022, 16:08 - Lieke: We sang the whole song together
05/09/2022, 16:08 - Sanne: Oh god
05/09/2022, 16:08 - Lieke: Even with full caps belting the chorus
05/09/2022, 16:08 - Sanne: Did you date her though?
05/09/2022, 16:09 - Lieke: Couldve but she partied too much and I was 19 and not a party person yet
05/09/2022, 16:09 - Lieke: I did see her at both a PVRIS and Hayley Kiyoko concert 😂😂
05/09/2022, 16:10 - Sanne: Lol
05/09/2022, 16:10 - Sanne: Well it counts then
05/09/2022, 16:10 - Sanne: If it was just a long conversation because of the song then it would have been cheating 😂
05/09/2022, 16:11 - Lieke: Hahaha no afterwards we did talk a lot and on Snapchat as well
05/09/2022, 16:12 - Lieke: So I think it does count🤭
05/09/2022, 16:12 - Sanne: Kirsten is very busy with her Tinder now and I suggested she optimises matters by using a filter quesion like "so wanna skip the chatting and go straight to the fucking?"
05/09/2022, 16:12 - Lieke: 😂😂😂😂
05/09/2022, 16:12 - Lieke: Probably works with men really well
05/09/2022, 16:12 - Sanne: And then she can create a modal answer that she can compare against their answers
05/09/2022, 16:13 - Lieke: Lol
05/09/2022, 16:13 - Lieke: I think her best could be "want some fuck"
05/09/2022, 16:13 - Sanne: Yeah no it counts 😘
05/09/2022, 16:13 - Sanne: Hahaha short and elegant, I like it
05/09/2022, 16:14 - Lieke: Very sweet as well I'd think
05/09/2022, 16:14 - Lieke: You politely ask
05/09/2022, 16:17 - Sanne: Yeah it shows that you are a very generous person
05/09/2022, 16:17 - Sanne: Offering things
05/09/2022, 16:31 - Lieke: Riiiiight
05/09/2022, 16:31 - Tim U.: Your strategies are starting to remind me of this
https://youtu.be/-TcLxlkc2pA
05/09/2022, 16:32 - Lieke: Hahahaha yesss I love that vifeo
05/09/2022, 16:34 - Lieke: I got you bluee😏
05/09/2022, 16:46 - Sanne: I was not familiar with this
05/09/2022, 16:46 - Sanne: Love it 😂
05/09/2022, 16:46 - Sanne: The "no Ron"
05/09/2022, 16:46 - Sanne: But he got all the things! The blue, the yellow, the sticks, the swiggety..
05/09/2022, 16:47 - Sanne: Honestly more heartbreaking then the whole Robert and Julia thing
05/09/2022, 16:53 - Lieke: Hahahahah
06/09/2022, 21:10 - Lieke: My roommate wants to give me my late birthday present but maybe I'll come afterwards 🙈
06/09/2022, 21:10 - Sanne: We are still at the poledance place and need to cycle and shower and such 😅
06/09/2022, 21:11 - Tim U.: Is she the present? 😏
06/09/2022, 21:11 - Sanne: But I could challenge you to some wingspan as alternative
06/09/2022, 21:11 - Sanne: I think so yes
06/09/2022, 22:06 - Sanne: So what's the status?
06/09/2022, 22:06 - Sanne: I finished my shower and will make myself a smoothie now so I'm ready to go in ten minutes or so ✨
06/09/2022, 22:07 - Tim U.: Eh due to your group messages I'm still playing with the German Bois, probably 30min still
06/09/2022, 22:20 - Sanne: Okido, we know me I'm slow anyways
06/09/2022, 22:20 - Sanne: I'll set up
06/09/2022, 22:36 - Tim U.: Done now
06/09/2022, 23:20 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
06/09/2022, 23:21 - Lieke: But then I had an emotional talk did some crying and now I'm too tired to play games🙈
06/09/2022, 23:21 - Lieke: Conclusion is im gonna move out but I have to find a place first😅
07/09/2022, 01:02 - Sanne: Cute 🥰
07/09/2022, 01:02 - Sanne: Nahw sleep well sis ❤️
07/09/2022, 01:03 - Sanne: Good luck! I have the faith in you
07/09/2022, 12:38 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
12/09/2022, 17:14 - Sanne: So how about tomorrow night Stardew?
12/09/2022, 17:32 - Tim U.: Could do
12/09/2022, 18:15 - Lieke: Oehh yeahb
13/09/2022, 16:33 - Tim U.: When would you want to start?
13/09/2022, 17:10 - Sanne: For me anytime, but sister is going to do half of our dance plans first
13/09/2022, 17:16 - Tim U.: Okay, I'll make food then
13/09/2022, 17:23 - Sanne: According to my calculations Lieke should be available around 20:30 but she can do her own
13/09/2022, 17:31 - Lieke: I think I'll join somewhere around 9 ish, poledancing ends at 20:30 then I still have to bike home and shower and stuff
13/09/2022, 17:48 - Sanne: Oh I thought you were gonna skip the pole bit?
13/09/2022, 17:48 - Lieke: Nahh if im already there I find it awkward to leave 😂😂
13/09/2022, 17:50 - Sanne: Ah yeah
13/09/2022, 17:50 - Tim U.: Plenty of time to procrastinate on tomorrow's exam then
13/09/2022, 17:50 - Sanne: I'll be impressed if you make 21 😅
13/09/2022, 17:51 - Sanne: Oh an exam already? That's fast!
13/09/2022, 21:14 - Lieke: Gonna shower and then im readyy
13/09/2022, 21:14 - Lieke: We need a whatapp group pic cause I already send stuff in the wrong group 😂😂😂
13/09/2022, 21:15 - Sanne: Too many bouldering groups 😅
13/09/2022, 21:16 - Sanne: We were too busy crying to take a group picture in the end
13/09/2022, 21:16 - Sanne: Maybe we can Frankenstein one
13/09/2022, 21:46 - Sanne: Timmy baby where you at?
13/09/2022, 21:47 - Tim U.: Omw :p
18/09/2022, 09:06 - Sanne: So the parents went to Germany and apparantly my mom had aspirations of becoming a German mom because she bought this atrocity:
18/09/2022, 09:06 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
18/09/2022, 14:00 - Tim U.: Uff
18/09/2022, 14:01 - Lieke: 😂😂😂
20/09/2022, 08:46 - Sanne: Hey! When do we farm again?
20/09/2022, 08:47 - Sanne: I could do tonight after poledancing (although we have established that we can't make anything before 21:30) or Thursday any time ✨
20/09/2022, 08:50 - Tim U.: Both works for me
20/09/2022, 12:31 - Lieke: Hmm I think tonight I'm gonna skip or just hang for like 1 hour I need sleep 😂
20/09/2022, 12:31 - Tim U.: The party life is hitting you hard? :p
20/09/2022, 12:32 - Lieke: Not even just the party life, I also just accidentally go sleep late cause I'm hanging with friends or chilling with the roommate🙈
20/09/2022, 12:33 - Tim U.: Rest well then 🙃
20/09/2022, 19:49 - Tim U.: To be clear, we don't have a session tonight then right? Some other friends asked me about gaming for the evening
20/09/2022, 21:35 - Sanne: I asked Lieke about it and she said she can make 22:15
20/09/2022, 21:36 - Sanne: And then for an hour or so
20/09/2022, 21:37 - Sanne: But if you found a more circumstantial gaming session then go for it I'd say 😅
20/09/2022, 21:38 - Tim U.: Could still do I think, I'll check with them
20/09/2022, 22:14 - Tim U.: What's your status?
20/09/2022, 22:17 - Sanne: Oh I took a mighty long shower
20/09/2022, 22:17 - Sanne: But I can be ready in a couple min. Sister is probably floating around somewhere
20/09/2022, 22:17 - Tim U.: I'm not ready 😅
20/09/2022, 22:17 - Sanne: Oh okay, that's good then 😂
20/09/2022, 22:27 - Sanne: Anyways, I think I'll go pet Lex for a bit but if anyone shows up I'm ready as I can be ✨
20/09/2022, 22:37 - Lieke: Me and my roommates had a full on rant about our shitty landlord
20/09/2022, 22:37 - Lieke: And planning what to write to him to hopefully end the discussion
20/09/2022, 22:37 - Lieke: Are you on discord call already?
20/09/2022, 22:38 - Sanne: No not yet
20/09/2022, 22:38 - Sanne: Will you still join then?
20/09/2022, 22:38 - Tim U.: I'll be ready in 5min
20/09/2022, 22:38 - Lieke: I can join for a little bit and then shower afterwards haha
20/09/2022, 22:40 - Sanne: 👍🏻
20/09/2022, 22:53 - Tim U.: There now
22/09/2022, 11:54 - Sanne: So do we stardew tonight then?
22/09/2022, 11:54 - Sanne: I heard some rumours
22/09/2022, 11:55 - Sanne: We don't have to! Only if it suits everyone
22/09/2022, 12:48 - Lieke: Yeahss but I don't know what time yet 🙈
22/09/2022, 12:49 - Sanne: Okido, let me know some hours in advance if possible 😅 might pop over to Nick's place for a bit if there's time
22/09/2022, 13:36 - Lieke: it'll probably be around 21:00 ish or something
22/09/2022, 13:47 - Sanne: Oh yeah that's good
22/09/2022, 20:36 - Lieke: Okay it'll be more 21:30 :)
22/09/2022, 20:58 - Sanne: Oh same for me haha
22/09/2022, 20:58 - Sanne: Needed to teach Nick about shagging
22/09/2022, 21:02 - Lieke: 😂😂👀
22/09/2022, 21:16 - Sanne: Just the word ;)
22/09/2022, 21:16 - Sanne: We are suggesting he fixes his homelessness by acquiring himself a relationship
22/09/2022, 21:16 - Sanne: Shag for a shack you know
22/09/2022, 21:37 - Sanne: So what's the status?
26/09/2022, 22:30 - Tim U.: https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/xomdw9/ಠ_ಠ/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=share_button
26/09/2022, 23:28 - Lieke: HAHAHAHHA
27/09/2022, 08:17 - Sanne: "Makes Haley happy"
27/09/2022, 08:17 - Sanne: I bet it does
27/09/2022, 08:17 - Sanne: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
27/09/2022, 08:18 - Sanne: Well I did keep one. I was like, it's super, could be useful
27/09/2022, 08:19 - Sanne: I guess they my character can't use it though. They probably thought it went to far to put that in 😅
27/09/2022, 08:19 - Tim U.: Apparently that quest randomise the actual desired item so it's not totally on purpose
27/09/2022, 08:21 - Sanne: OMG that's amazing
27/09/2022, 08:21 - Sanne: I love a good coincedence
28/09/2022, 22:47 - Sanne: Maybe we can game some this weekend?
28/09/2022, 22:47 - Sanne: I don't seem to have a lot going on then
28/09/2022, 22:51 - Tim U.: Works for me
28/09/2022, 23:01 - Lieke: Maybe somewhere on Sunday? Other days I'm not really home 🙈🙈
28/09/2022, 23:04 - Sanne: Yeah Sunday could do
28/09/2022, 23:04 - Sanne: Bet I'll need the distraction 😅 start work on Monday and maybe I am stress
28/09/2022, 23:58 - Lieke: Nahww you'll do fine! 😘
02/10/2022, 18:43 - Sanne: Hey! So Lieke and I had a secret meeting and it turns out she kinda forgot but she can meet us around 20 for a short gaming session
02/10/2022, 18:44 - Sanne: Dunno if you were expecting us Tim 😅 but let us know how you feel 💚
02/10/2022, 18:44 - Tim U.: Then I just need to see whether Lukas will pull the same move on me (he said we could play today but hasn't shown any signs of life since)
02/10/2022, 18:52 - Lieke: Aight let us know ❤️
02/10/2022, 19:11 - Tim U.: As expected, Lukas is more busy than usual so I'm available
02/10/2022, 19:19 - Sanne: Cool
02/10/2022, 19:19 - Sanne: Yeah two things randomly working out? No one is that lucky 😅
02/10/2022, 19:20 - Sanne: Oh btw, can we stream for Lex? He has fomo and wants to chat with us
02/10/2022, 19:20 - Sanne: Or do we want to? I mean
02/10/2022, 19:21 - Sanne: I think we have the knowhow available
02/10/2022, 19:23 - Tim U.: Discord makes it very easy at mediocre quality, alternatively I could put it on twitch for higher quality
02/10/2022, 19:46 - Lieke: I think discord quality is alright, I watch streaming that way all the time haha
02/10/2022, 19:47 - Tim U.: Tbf stardew isn't exactly high definition by itself xD
02/10/2022, 19:57 - Sanne: Yeah just what is the easiest I guess
02/10/2022, 19:58 - Sanne: Lex says if you stream over twitch you might accidentally get rich and famous
02/10/2022, 19:59 - Tim U.: Unlikely given that I'd only stream the game and no video or voice
02/10/2022, 20:12 - Sanne: Tim we need you ❤️
02/10/2022, 20:13 - Tim U.: Sorry getting another bread out of the oven
04/10/2022, 20:45 - Sanne: I just got home from the work outing today and I am dead 😅 everone was too nice! I tried to hide in a corner and be on my phone looking busy during one of the breaks and they still _found me_
04/10/2022, 20:45 - Sanne: Way too much human interaction to be legal
04/10/2022, 20:45 - Tim U.: Better stay home for a few days
04/10/2022, 20:57 - Sanne: I haven't unlocked working from home yet :(
04/10/2022, 20:58 - Tim U.: Is it possible with that job?
04/10/2022, 20:59 - Sanne: In theory yes, depending on what you have planned for the day. But they kinda don't want me to
04/10/2022, 21:01 - Sanne: They have a lot of assistants in the office that need guidance and in time I would have to guide them also and then it would be a bit of a dick move not to come
05/10/2022, 15:39 - Sanne: One of my colleagues is vegan! I can bake her things 👀
05/10/2022, 15:40 - Sanne: She's pretty and I think she's bisexual, since she has two nosepiercings. Another colleague has one nosepiercing and she's a lesbian so two must mean bi right?
05/10/2022, 15:41 - Sanne: (Still processing all the gossip I heard yesterday)
05/10/2022, 15:44 - Tim U.: Seems like a lot to take in
05/10/2022, 15:45 - Tim U.: I'd wager that they'll enjoy your baked goods regardless of sexuality tho
05/10/2022, 16:22 - Sanne: Yeah those are unconnected bits of information 😅
05/10/2022, 17:30 - Lieke: Ooh sounds interesting 😂👀
09/10/2022, 21:10 - Sanne: Hey! When do we game again?
09/10/2022, 21:11 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
12/10/2022, 17:32 - Lieke: I can do tomorrow evening ☺️
12/10/2022, 17:32 - Lieke: Im going shopping but afterwards I'm open for some gaming 😏
12/10/2022, 19:19 - Sanne: Sounds good 👍🏻
13/10/2022, 19:05 - Sanne: Hey sweeties, I am actually pretty sick so no gaming for me tonight :(
13/10/2022, 19:05 - Sanne: I have to continue my schedule of napping and asking Lex to bring me food and then napping some more and complaining the food is cold
13/10/2022, 19:15 - Tim U.: Well then I hope you'll get warm food soon so you can recover
13/10/2022, 19:18 - Sanne: Thanks <3 I just ate some but it's starting to cool down so I guess more napping now 😴
13/10/2022, 21:13 - Lieke: Nahww that's alright we'll just game next time ❤️
15/10/2022, 17:23 - Sanne: Btw, I am starting to feel like a person again 💪🏻 healthy enough for gaming hang outs I would say. So let me know when you guys wanna reschedule ✨
15/10/2022, 18:00 - Tim U.: I'm up as usual :)
15/10/2022, 18:25 - Lieke: Maybe we can do Sunday evening?
15/10/2022, 19:03 - Sanne: Yeah works for me
16/10/2022, 18:47 - Sanne: So what time where you thinking?
16/10/2022, 18:48 - Sanne: Then I can try and plan around eating and suffering 🌈
16/10/2022, 19:03 - Lieke: Hmm maybe around 20:30 ish?
16/10/2022, 20:32 - Lieke: Im gonna finish my food so I could be online 20:45 :)
16/10/2022, 20:34 - Tim U.: :)
16/10/2022, 20:34 - Sanne: Okido, I am still setting up myself
17/10/2022, 08:57 - Sanne: I woke up feeling like shit and then I drank two sips of water and I felt like throwing up. Then I got up and took my temperature and it was 39! (But I feel fresh like a person with 38 fever) So I figured today is the day I will pass my covid test!
17/10/2022, 08:58 - Sanne: Then I felt so sick that I fumbled it 😅 I spilled test fluid all over the bed. So I took another one, still feeling like it was going to be a winner
17/10/2022, 08:58 - Sanne: But it's negative! Still..
17/10/2022, 08:59 - Sanne: I don't get why I'm still not testing positive. Shitty tests..
17/10/2022, 08:59 - Sanne: The people have a right to know!
17/10/2022, 10:07 - Lieke: Hahah probably not enough antibodies yet or you actually have something else
17/10/2022, 11:20 - Sanne: Or both. Would be classic me to first have a stomach flue and just slide into covid after
17/10/2022, 13:03 - Tim U.: At this point I just hope you get well soon
17/10/2022, 13:17 - Sanne: Yeah in the end it doesn't really matter what it is, not going anywhere anyways
17/10/2022, 13:18 - Sanne: Thanks ✨ I'm working on it
26/10/2022, 18:43 - Sanne: 👀
26/10/2022, 18:44 - Tim U.: Tonight I actually can't because of an exam tomorrow morning
26/10/2022, 19:02 - Sanne: Haha you know me, I don't even need to use my words. But it doesn't have to be _now_, I'm assuming Lieke has a tight schedule anyway
26/10/2022, 23:38 - Lieke: I don't know if I can do this week, depends on if the party gets canceled on Saturday or not 🙈
27/10/2022, 08:06 - Sanne: Oh I can't do Saturday anyway, so it will have to be next week then
29/10/2022, 12:03 - Sanne: I convinced Lex that now that I am a gamer girl, I should have the bigger desk and he agreed
29/10/2022, 12:04 - Sanne: And the entire house is one big fucking mess and everything needs to get a new place
29/10/2022, 12:04 - Sanne: But it is apparant where my priorities are
29/10/2022, 12:04 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
29/10/2022, 12:07 - Sanne: Ooh and we bought a closet so we can _finally_ put the wingspan set somewhere 😂 after almost three months of moving it around
29/10/2022, 12:08 - Sanne: So yeah I have a clean desk for gaming now, perhaps I'll use it now. Who knew, the secret was to pick up all the stuff on your desk and just place it everywhere else 🌈
29/10/2022, 12:14 - Lieke: Hahahah looks good tho
29/10/2022, 13:05 - Tim U.: Pretty neat
29/10/2022, 13:32 - Sanne: Well it's already a bit messier now 😅 but ssh
29/10/2022, 13:33 - Sanne: I included a place for platkat do to catnaps
29/10/2022, 13:33 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
29/10/2022, 13:34 - Sanne: So now people can just look at that and ignore any mess that will unavoidably collect
29/10/2022, 13:35 - Lieke: Only important thing to see haha
06/11/2022, 11:45 - Sanne: Do you think I am compensating for not having the dad I wished I had by buying clothes that look like they belong to a dad?
06/11/2022, 11:46 - Lieke: 100% yes
06/11/2022, 11:46 - Lieke: Same here
06/11/2022, 11:48 - Sanne: 😂
06/11/2022, 11:51 - Sanne: I think my dad is a big Scottish guy from the 50s and he's pretty smart
06/11/2022, 12:45 - Lieke: Hahahha
06/11/2022, 12:46 - Lieke: Mine is a jock who only eats chicken nuggets
06/11/2022, 13:19 - Sanne: 😂 but that's you
06/11/2022, 20:58 - Lieke: Let's do gaming Wednesday!
06/11/2022, 21:21 - Tim U.: :o
06/11/2022, 21:21 - Tim U.: My Wednesday is still completely open
06/11/2022, 21:21 - Lieke: 🥳🥳🥳
06/11/2022, 21:35 - Sanne: Do you have other days as option too btw?
06/11/2022, 21:37 - Sanne: Lex wanted to hang out then, but if you're busy he'll have to wait 😅
06/11/2022, 22:31 - Lieke: Uhm idk maybe Tuesday after poledancing but then I'd be only for a little bit
06/11/2022, 22:37 - Sanne: Yeah that would be suboptimal
06/11/2022, 22:38 - Sanne: Then let's do Wednesday ✨
06/11/2022, 22:39 - Sanne: I'll figure something out with Lex. We live together so shouldn't be too hard
09/11/2022, 19:36 - Sanne: Oh shit we game today right?
09/11/2022, 19:36 - Sanne: I'm still at work 🙈
09/11/2022, 19:37 - Tim U.: I have 2 deadlines for midnight 😅
09/11/2022, 19:42 - Tim U.: 1 is already done but the other one still needs work
09/11/2022, 19:44 - Sanne: Much work?
09/11/2022, 19:45 - Tim U.: Ehh at least an hour or 2
09/11/2022, 19:45 - Sanne: I am just about done here so I am probably available from 21 or 21:30
09/11/2022, 19:45 - Tim U.: I'll make haste
09/11/2022, 19:45 - Sanne: So a short session later is an option if you feel like it
09/11/2022, 19:45 - Sanne: Nah no rush, education is important 💪🏻
09/11/2022, 19:46 - Tim U.: It's a mandatory business course and I intend to reject monetary dogma :p
09/11/2022, 19:55 - Sanne: Haha fair
09/11/2022, 20:19 - Lieke: I'll do a quick workout and then im also available
09/11/2022, 20:57 - Tim U.: If I'm not done by whatever starting time I would be open to at least hang out on discord while continuing to work
09/11/2022, 20:58 - Sanne: I am almost done eating ✨
09/11/2022, 20:59 - Sanne: But yeah sure, I can do some sewing then. Real life Stardew Valley
09/11/2022, 21:02 - Tim U.: Artisan goods ✨
09/11/2022, 21:06 - Sanne: Oui
09/11/2022, 21:07 - Sanne: Ooh I got discord on my phone now 👀 less effort
09/11/2022, 21:08 - Tim U.: Technology 🌈
09/11/2022, 21:08 - Sanne: You can call me if you want but we can also wait for Lieke, dunno when she will be ready
09/11/2022, 21:08 - Sanne: That's right!
09/11/2022, 21:09 - Tim U.: Well I am probably faster at working before the call 😅
09/11/2022, 21:12 - Sanne: You don't think I could help?
09/11/2022, 21:13 - Tim U.: Heh could try
20/11/2022, 16:13 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
20/11/2022, 16:25 - Tim U.: Somewhat relatable 😅
20/11/2022, 19:16 - Lieke: Hahaha I've had that before
20/11/2022, 20:11 - Sanne: Yeah it made me think of our bouldering session without bouldering 😂
20/11/2022, 20:12 - Sanne: That wasn't aimed at me but still, I'll cry when the vibe is there
20/11/2022, 20:16 - Lieke: Hahahah yeahh I started that one
20/11/2022, 20:31 - Lieke: I could do Stardew Tonight btw 😏
20/11/2022, 20:33 - Tim U.: Oh boi
20/11/2022, 20:33 - Tim U.: Good that im already halfway done with dinner
20/11/2022, 20:47 - Lieke: Nicee :)
20/11/2022, 20:53 - Sanne: I'm on the train
20/11/2022, 20:53 - Sanne: I'll be home at 22 so I could join for a bit but I might want sleep then
20/11/2022, 21:05 - Lieke: Ahh that's okay you can see
20/11/2022, 21:48 - Sanne: I'm home!
20/11/2022, 21:48 - Sanne: I can make 22 if you are still hype about gaming
20/11/2022, 21:57 - Tim U.: We're online
20/11/2022, 22:02 - Sanne: Uh I meant 5 past of course
20/11/2022, 23:16 - Sanne: Turns out it's 15,5 degrees in the living room, no wonder my hands were cold 😅
20/11/2022, 23:16 - Sanne: When I got home though I was just like "this is not outside, nice"
20/11/2022, 23:16 - Lieke: Pfff in the Kitchen her it's 14.4🫠
20/11/2022, 23:17 - Lieke: Our heating is not working properly
21/11/2022, 07:58 - Sanne: Oh noo that sounds oof
21/11/2022, 07:59 - Sanne: Do you think your landlord will fix it or is he like yess you can saves the money now
21/11/2022, 08:04 - Sanne: Lex says you can hide here if u want
21/11/2022, 19:22 - Sanne: Btw, I checked and I think Sunday will be best for gaming this week if we want to do weekend ✨ or maybe Saturday afternoon but that's probably crafting chaos day
21/11/2022, 19:26 - Tim U.: I can probably do either
21/11/2022, 19:33 - Lieke: Ahh that's sweet, I bought a big blanket hoody now as well
21/11/2022, 19:33 - Lieke: And they fixed it kinda now
21/11/2022, 19:34 - Lieke: I think I can do Sunday as well
21/11/2022, 19:38 - Sanne: Nice
26/11/2022, 19:57 - Tim U.: https://www.reddit.com/r/AbsoluteUnits/comments/z58m30/absolute_unit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=share_button
26/11/2022, 19:57 - Tim U.: Lieke's fitness goals?
26/11/2022, 20:02 - Lieke: 👀👀
26/11/2022, 20:04 - Lieke: If only I had good genes, could eat heathy/enough protein and workout regularly 😂
26/11/2022, 20:11 - Tim U.: Aren't you doing some of these things?
26/11/2022, 21:44 - Lieke: Yeahh truee but the genes part is a big factor haha
27/11/2022, 01:19 - Sanne: Oh the post doesn't exist anymore
27/11/2022, 01:19 - Sanne: I'll have an opinion anyways
27/11/2022, 01:20 - Sanne: Just gotta work harder I guess!
27/11/2022, 01:21 - Sanne: I had a day

27/11/2022, 01:21 - Sanne: It's complicated
27/11/2022, 01:21 - Sanne: We game tomorrow right?
27/11/2022, 01:36 - Tim U.: Thought so
27/11/2022, 01:36 - Tim U.: Nice boat you got there
27/11/2022, 09:42 - Sanne: Thank you, I worked hard. I think?
27/11/2022, 09:42 - Sanne: In return I received some human sized scrunchies so I could finally live my dream of dressing up like a scrunchie
27/11/2022, 09:44 - Sanne: Do we game this afternoon or evening?
27/11/2022, 09:50 - Lieke: Hahahah sweeeet
27/11/2022, 09:51 - Lieke: Oehh we could also game a bit in the afternoon. Then I can download Steam on moms laptop. I forgot that I don't have a laptop/pc when im at Lians 😂🙈
27/11/2022, 10:46 - Sanne: Mom probably thinks she'll get a virus from that 😅
27/11/2022, 12:01 - Lieke: Hahaha 😂😂
27/11/2022, 12:31 - Tim U.: So what's afternoon?
27/11/2022, 12:37 - Lieke: Maybe around 16:00 ish?
27/11/2022, 13:10 - Sanne: Sure
27/11/2022, 13:11 - Sanne: I'm excited ✨ I'll save myself for you guys then and not game before
27/11/2022, 13:17 - Tim U.: Crazy
27/11/2022, 13:46 - Sanne: Mhm
27/11/2022, 13:46 - Sanne: All these sacrifices I'm willing to make cause I luv you guys so much ❤️
27/11/2022, 15:14 - Lieke: Shall we do around 15:30 ish? I'll have a quick shower and then i'm ready ☺️
27/11/2022, 15:28 - Sanne: Yup I'll be a couple minutes
27/11/2022, 15:36 - Tim U.: 👀
28/11/2022, 08:48 - Sanne: Yesterday I felt like pff I've had covid, this regular cold virus does not scare me. I regret 😅 it's a strong boi
28/11/2022, 10:07 - Tim U.: Uh oh, hope you get well soon
28/11/2022, 10:25 - Lieke: Oof 😢
28/11/2022, 10:25 - Lieke: Hopefully you beat it fast!
28/11/2022, 10:32 - Sanne: Mhm I got trash tv so
28/11/2022, 10:33 - Lieke: Oehh go watch Warrior Nun
28/11/2022, 10:53 - Sanne: Guess what I'm doing 😅
28/11/2022, 10:54 - Lieke: Don't call Warrior nun trash tv 😮
28/11/2022, 11:12 - Sanne: I'm sorry, it's enlightening content!
28/11/2022, 12:26 - Tim U.: Back on that farming grind I see 👀
28/11/2022, 12:32 - Sanne: Well, fresh air is healthy right 😅🙈
28/11/2022, 12:39 - Lieke: hahaha damn right
28/11/2022, 18:22 - Sanne: I somehow got into watching these videos where Magnus (and sometimes his gf) do these military fitness challenges and maybe it's cause I'm stuck on the couch but I kinda wanna try now?
28/11/2022, 18:22 - Sanne: Would you guys care to join sometime?
28/11/2022, 18:23 - Sanne: Won't be interesting if it's just me failing 😂 someone needs to get it for comparison
28/11/2022, 18:24 - Tim U.: Depends a bit which of these challenges
28/11/2022, 18:25 - Sanne: A relatively easy one without too many material demands
28/11/2022, 18:25 - Sanne: Like swimming would be a hassle and I really suck at that 😅
28/11/2022, 18:26 - Sanne: I think most of them are just sit ups, push ups, pull ups and a run
28/11/2022, 18:28 - Sanne: I haven't really run since the second ankle injury but maybe I can do it when I believe in myself
28/11/2022, 18:28 - Sanne: For running it would also be nice to have an official track so you don't have to google maps the meters. Or! We can ignore it exists ✨
28/11/2022, 18:30 - Sanne: You guys can pick one that seems doable. I'll just be there to amuse you with my failures and maybe feel motivated to train more after
28/11/2022, 23:31 - Lieke: I'd everything except running 😂
28/11/2022, 23:35 - Tim U.: Preferably climbing
29/11/2022, 08:25 - Lieke: hahaha exactly
29/11/2022, 09:49 - Sanne: 😂
29/11/2022, 09:49 - Sanne: Fair
03/12/2022, 18:11 - Tim U.: Any gaming chances this weekend? 👀
03/12/2022, 18:34 - Lieke: Maybe Tonight? 👀
03/12/2022, 18:34 - Tim U.: Oho
03/12/2022, 18:34 - Tim U.: Hit up the group on discord when you feel like it
03/12/2022, 18:38 - Sanne: Lieke is going on a solo bouldering mission (I'm too sore) n she'll be back around 21:30
03/12/2022, 18:39 - Sanne: I'll probs be gaming before that
03/12/2022, 18:39 - Sanne: And downloading stuff for Lieke on mom's laptop
03/12/2022, 18:39 - Tim U.: Porn? 👉🏻👈🏻
03/12/2022, 18:40 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
03/12/2022, 19:14 - Sanne: Porn and drugs
06/12/2022, 12:57 - Sanne: I'm at a school again for work and we were joking about me passing as a student and then I said "what if they bully me" and then my colleague made a joke about finding me upside down in a trash can later and I asked how many students it would take to put me in and he thought two would suffice 😂
06/12/2022, 12:57 - Sanne: Two big ones though! So I'm not too insulted
06/12/2022, 13:17 - Tim U.: Probably depends how much you can un-compose yourself
06/12/2022, 13:40 - Sanne: Haha myeah I shouldn't hit them. And I'm breaking in new shoes so I can't run away 😅
06/12/2022, 13:41 - Sanne: I'm a sitting duck 🦆
06/12/2022, 13:41 - Tim U.: QUACK
06/12/2022, 13:41 - Tim U.: Sorry reflex
06/12/2022, 14:40 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
06/12/2022, 18:54 - Sanne: 🥰wanna be that duck
06/12/2022, 18:54 - Sanne: I keep typing fuck 😂
06/12/2022, 18:55 - Sanne: Waar het hart vol van is, loopt de mond van over
06/12/2022, 19:03 - Lieke: 😂😂
08/12/2022, 11:52 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
08/12/2022, 14:18 - Sanne: Cool
08/12/2022, 14:18 - Sanne: Campus a 6something and shout "wow, first time"
08/12/2022, 14:22 - Tim U.: Do that after finding some people who struggle with it and pretend it's your first week of bouldering
08/12/2022, 14:37 - Sanne: You can say "oh I didn't know you were allowed to use your feet. There's no tape to tell me where they should go"
08/12/2022, 16:15 - Lieke: Hahah I should've done that 😂😂
08/12/2022, 17:58 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
08/12/2022, 18:01 - Sanne: Ooh that seems cool
08/12/2022, 18:10 - Tim U.: How does that even work? 🤔
08/12/2022, 20:27 - Lieke: Idk I couldn't see the rules but it looked cool tho
11/12/2022, 11:39 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
11/12/2022, 11:49 - Lieke: 😂😂😂
15/12/2022, 18:50 - Tim U.: Heyo, bouldering tomorrow? 🙃
15/12/2022, 19:40 - Lieke: Can't do Tomorrow but I can do Sunday! 😏

15/12/2022, 22:25 - Sanne: Both!
15/12/2022, 22:25 - Sanne: No uh, I'll join that :)
15/12/2022, 22:25 - Sanne: I'm more excited than emojis can express
15/12/2022, 22:43 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
15/12/2022, 23:23 - Sanne: Haha that exactly!
15/12/2022, 23:23 - Sanne: I forget gifs
16/12/2022, 14:39 - Sanne: Hmm doesn't seem like I'll make 15 😅 but who will
16/12/2022, 14:44 - Tim U.: Yeh
16/12/2022, 22:37 - Tim U.: Bouldering + wingspan on sunday would work from my side btw
16/12/2022, 23:31 - Sanne: Yay ✨
16/12/2022, 23:31 - Sanne: My place is available for the wingspan bit (as all the stuff is here anyways)
16/12/2022, 23:32 - Sanne: Lieke would you also wanna join that? Or just boulderin?
17/12/2022, 15:53 - Lieke: I'll join for just the bouldering cause I still have to make 2  banana breads on Sunday 😂
17/12/2022, 15:53 - Lieke: Alsoo I was thinking of bouldering at 15:45/16:00 on Sunday?
17/12/2022, 16:02 - Tim U.: Could do
17/12/2022, 16:23 - Sanne: Yeah sounds good
17/12/2022, 16:24 - Sanne: I might come a little earlier cause I really _really_ need to get new shoes
17/12/2022, 16:24 - Sanne: Oh and uh Roefus will join Lieke
17/12/2022, 16:25 - Sanne: I think you'll like him. He's also autistic
17/12/2022, 21:16 - Lieke: Hahah yeah? Get those I have 😉
17/12/2022, 21:17 - Lieke: Oeh that's nicee
17/12/2022, 21:17 - Lieke: How do you know Roefus?
17/12/2022, 21:17 - Lieke: My phone is still in Dutch autocorrect and wanted to say tiefus 😂😂
17/12/2022, 21:17 - Sanne: That's the plan so far, we'll see
17/12/2022, 21:18 - Sanne: He is Lukas his bf's friend
17/12/2022, 21:19 - Sanne: I introduced him to Nick as my German's German's bf's friend. It was not weird
17/12/2022, 21:19 - Tim U.: 🤔
17/12/2022, 21:20 - Lieke: Hahah 😂
18/12/2022, 12:01 - Tim U.: A little like 10min or 30+min
18/12/2022, 12:04 - Sanne: Depends 😅
18/12/2022, 12:05 - Sanne: I am now more blanket than human but there i still quite some time so I can find motivation
18/12/2022, 12:06 - Lieke: Hahah the later the better for me :P
18/12/2022, 12:13 - Sanne: Are you still panick baking?
18/12/2022, 13:21 - Lieke: Oh im gonna panick bake after bouldering 😂😂
18/12/2022, 13:46 - Sanne: What are you doing now then?
18/12/2022, 14:00 - Lieke: In Utrecht 🙈
18/12/2022, 14:00 - Lieke: Going to nimma now
18/12/2022, 14:34 - Sanne: Of course 😅
18/12/2022, 15:20 - Sanne: Hmmm like not earlier at all probably 🙈
18/12/2022, 15:21 - Sanne: I had surprise clean landry I needed to hang
18/12/2022, 15:26 - Tim U.: So :45 or just 16?
18/12/2022, 15:32 - Sanne: Exactly!
18/12/2022, 15:32 - Sanne: Closer to 45 I think
19/12/2022, 18:12 - Tim U.: Any idea yet when there'd possibly be bouldering tomorrow?
19/12/2022, 18:16 - Lieke: Im there now 😂
19/12/2022, 18:16 - Tim U.: Well well well
19/12/2022, 18:16 - Tim U.: What does that mean for tomorrow? :p
19/12/2022, 18:17 - Lieke: But Tomorrow as well lol. Maybe after dinner maybe before I don't really mind 🤭
19/12/2022, 18:17 - Lieke: I want to rehype my boulder addiction
19/12/2022, 18:17 - Lieke: I don't know what would be most suitable for you?
19/12/2022, 18:20 - Tim U.: Ideally in the afternoon so that I'd be done around 5/6
19/12/2022, 18:20 - Tim U.: Not sure if that's too early for you working people
19/12/2022, 18:22 - Lieke: Oh no I could do 5 for sure ☺️
19/12/2022, 18:22 - Lieke: I did the blue in the cave and made some boys believe that they can do it easily😂😂
19/12/2022, 18:23 - Tim U.: (To be clear I meant being done at 5, not starting at 5)
19/12/2022, 18:24 - Tim U.: Naiz
19/12/2022, 18:25 - Lieke: Ooh wait I read that wrong 🙈. I could join starting 16:30 ish at earliest
19/12/2022, 18:26 - Lieke: Maybe a bit earlier so between 16:15 and 16:30 :)
19/12/2022, 18:29 - Tim U.: 16:30 can work
19/12/2022, 18:29 - Sanne: I have the christmas thing with work so tomorrow I'll be busy with that until like 21 ish I think. We'll have dinner as well
19/12/2022, 18:29 - Sanne: I can do Wednesday? But maybe that's too many bouldering for everyone
19/12/2022, 18:32 - Tim U.: Wednesday I can't in the evening
19/12/2022, 18:36 - Sanne: Could do afternoon as well, work hours are optional for me this week 😅
19/12/2022, 18:42 - Tim U.: Nvm Wednesday I'm scheduled for 2pm already
19/12/2022, 18:44 - Lieke: Nahh I'm down to boulder Wednesday as well
19/12/2022, 19:36 - Lieke: Omg they have ropes just like they had in the gym hall with freerunning 👀👀
19/12/2022, 19:44 - Sanne: Who have ropes?
19/12/2022, 19:47 - Lieke: Grip
19/12/2022, 19:54 - Sanne: Daamn
20/12/2022, 14:03 - Tim U.: I'll be there earlier already to introduce another friend to bouldering, hope you don't mind having a fresh noob around for later 🙃
20/12/2022, 14:32 - Lieke: Yeah no worries the more the merrier :)
20/12/2022, 16:14 - Lieke: I was a little bit delayed at work but I should be there 16:45
23/12/2022, 20:05 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
23/12/2022, 20:09 - Sanne: Daaamn it's a chonk
23/12/2022, 21:05 - Lieke: Hahah thats a big boyyy
24/12/2022, 19:40 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
24/12/2022, 19:42 - Lieke: The bandana looks nicely with the suit haha!
24/12/2022, 19:42 - Tim U.: My dad would probably say it adds too much colour with the tie but I think even he accepts the headband on its own :D
24/12/2022, 19:43 - Lieke: Nicee, that's just your version of fancy with headbands
24/12/2022, 19:52 - Sanne: Nice, looking good ❤️
28/12/2022, 11:20 - Sanne: https://i.redd.it/twy1s6yg6k8a1.jpg
28/12/2022, 11:34 - Lieke: Hahaha😂😂
28/12/2022, 11:36 - Sanne: Funny cause you had some 😅
28/12/2022, 11:36 - Sanne: Haha trauma 🌈🥲
28/12/2022, 11:44 - Lieke: I make jokes about it cause then it "wasn't that bad"
28/12/2022, 12:06 - Sanne: Mhm ❤️
28/12/2022, 19:33 - Tim U.: Just to let you know; I'll be available for bouldering/climbing starting Friday evening until the 7th
28/12/2022, 19:45 - Sanne: Oooh good stuff
28/12/2022, 19:48 - Lieke: Oehh 👀👀
28/12/2022, 19:59 - Tim U.: Already got rope climbing planned for Monday evening, otherwise flexible
28/12/2022, 20:29 - Sanne: Whoops I got distracted by a puzzle emergency
28/12/2022, 20:29 - Sanne: I'll be planting trees Friday so I'm probably too tired after that 😅 but I'm really excited to do some bouldering again after this nassty flu
28/12/2022, 21:14 - Sanne: Hmm I see they are closed on Sunday. So maybe I'll go Saturday before 16?
28/12/2022, 21:16 - Tim U.: They close at 16 so should go around 13?
28/12/2022, 21:32 - Lieke: I'm available on Friday 🥰
28/12/2022, 21:58 - Tim U.: Can also go Friday evening, let me know what time works for you 🙃
28/12/2022, 22:44 - Lieke: Hmm maybe after dinner somewhere?
28/12/2022, 23:09 - Sanne: Yeah something like that
28/12/2022, 23:11 - Tim U.: I will await more precise estimates until then :p
29/12/2022, 00:11 - Lieke: Hahah yess I'll ask my Austrian friend who will also join
29/12/2022, 12:04 - Sanne: Oh no, they mean to start with the trees in the morning already
29/12/2022, 12:05 - Tim U.: Oof
29/12/2022, 12:05 - Sanne: Realistically, I have no self control and will show up for bouldering just to lie on the mat and complain 💚
30/12/2022, 13:05 - Lieke: Okayy so the plan is to bouldering around 16:45 maybe?
30/12/2022, 13:05 - Lieke: But I could also do after dinner if that's better
30/12/2022, 13:31 - Sanne: Yeah if I'm joining it would be more of an after dinner thing
30/12/2022, 13:56 - Tim U.: I'm back in Nijmegen now so that works
30/12/2022, 16:04 - Lieke: Depends on if you wanna join when we do it then
30/12/2022, 16:14 - Tim U.: So are we doing 16:45 now or later? 🤔
30/12/2022, 16:15 - Lieke: Idk if sanne wanted to join
30/12/2022, 16:15 - Lieke: Work takes a bit longer so for me if we go around that time it'll look more like 17:15 ish 🙈
30/12/2022, 16:17 - Tim U.: So we aim for 17:15 until Sanne responds?
30/12/2022, 16:25 - Lieke: Yess let's keep it at that for now :)
30/12/2022, 17:11 - Sanne: Heyo I just caught a ride home and I am nasty
30/12/2022, 17:11 - Sanne: But uhm, I could head over in a bit I guess if you are there?
30/12/2022, 17:13 - Tim U.: I'm getting omw now 😅
30/12/2022, 17:26 - Lieke: I'm here now :)
30/12/2022, 17:29 - Sanne: On my way now too ✨
30/12/2022, 17:30 - Sanne: Damn I'm cold
31/12/2022, 10:32 - Sanne: I have turned into my own cat. I keep finding this mouse skull that I brought yesterday that I then left in the bathroom, apparantly thinking "I brought my human a nice surprise present, humans like dead things!"
31/12/2022, 10:32 - Sanne: What am I to do with a tiny skull?
31/12/2022, 10:34 - Lieke: Put it on display on your desk between al the plants 😉
31/12/2022, 11:45 - Sanne: Hmm good idea, I can make a little display pillow for it
31/12/2022, 11:45 - Sanne: Uh so btw, I'm assuming we are not going bouldering anymore today 😅
31/12/2022, 11:46 - Sanne: I only just managed to shower and it will take me at least 4 more hours to motivate myself to leave the house and then it's too late to go lol
31/12/2022, 11:46 - Lieke: Hahah yeahh I also didn't go yet 😂😂
31/12/2022, 11:47 - Lieke: I think I'm catching the flu that has been going around
31/12/2022, 11:47 - Lieke: Or I'm just really tired
31/12/2022, 11:49 - Sanne: Oh noo the flu is a bitch, hope it's just tired
31/12/2022, 11:49 - Sanne: And hope it wasn't me 😅 but I'm pretty sure I'm safe after a full week
31/12/2022, 12:10 - Lieke: Yeahh same
31/12/2022, 12:10 - Lieke: But we'll see a lot of people are kinda sick around me so could be anyone
31/12/2022, 12:14 - Tim U.: I also just got up and still feel tired 😅
31/12/2022, 12:46 - Sanne: Then we'll boulder in the new year 💪🏻
31/12/2022, 12:46 - Sanne: Have a chill day peeps ❤️
31/12/2022, 14:53 - Lieke: You tooo❤️
01/01/2023, 15:52 - Sanne: Oh wow my two working braincells just connected something
01/01/2023, 15:52 - Sanne: We actually have a cousin moving to Stockholm soon
01/01/2023, 15:54 - Sanne: So we can have a little Sweden trip and visit her too and then the no direct flight thing is less of an issue
01/01/2023, 15:55 - Sanne: And we'll seem like good cousins
01/01/2023, 16:06 - Tim U.: Sounds a bit like you're using your cousin as an excuse :p
01/01/2023, 16:14 - Sanne: Haha no I was just thinking if only we had something to do in Stockholm
01/01/2023, 16:14 - Sanne: I like to combine visits, makes me feel like a travel person
01/01/2023, 16:58 - Tim U.: Ah I see
01/01/2023, 17:56 - Sanne: And you know, our bank accounts will be happier if we combine them
01/01/2023, 18:03 - Tim U.: Wait what? 😅
01/01/2023, 18:04 - Sanne: Haha this conversation doesn't feel smooth
01/01/2023, 18:04 - Sanne: You live in Sweden now yes?
01/01/2023, 18:05 - Sanne: We wanne visit
01/01/2023, 18:05 - Sanne: Cousin will live in Sweden
01/01/2023, 18:05 - Sanne: We also wanne visit
01/01/2023, 18:05 - Sanne: So instead of going to Sweden twice, we could go once
01/01/2023, 18:05 - Tim U.: Oh combine the visits yes
01/01/2023, 18:06 - Tim U.: I read it as 'our bank account will be happier if we combine our bank accounts'
01/01/2023, 18:06 - Sanne: Oooh like that
01/01/2023, 18:06 - Sanne: I don't know what they're into
01/01/2023, 18:06 - Sanne: I guess they like money on them
01/01/2023, 18:54 - Lieke: Oehh nicee that's actually a really good idea
01/01/2023, 18:57 - Sanne: Mhm I know right
02/01/2023, 10:55 - Sanne: Oh should we plan a Wingspan night before our weeks fill up?
02/01/2023, 12:08 - Tim U.: Mine doesn't really do that but can do
02/01/2023, 12:10 - Sanne: Yeah I was thinking Lieke mostly 🙈
02/01/2023, 12:12 - Sanne: I can do all the nights still, except Thursday cause then Lieke and I will start our official climbing journey
02/01/2023, 13:37 - Lieke: I can do either tonight or friday :)
02/01/2023, 13:48 - Sanne: See, that's a nasty schedule 😅
02/01/2023, 13:48 - Sanne: I can do both still
02/01/2023, 15:08 - Tim U.: Today I'm going climbing at 4 so it would've have to be in the later evening. Friday is still open
02/01/2023, 15:20 - Sanne: I'm terrible at making decisions 😅
02/01/2023, 15:20 - Sanne: What if both!
02/01/2023, 15:44 - Lieke: hahaha lets do tonight maybe and then we can see if we wanna do friday as well?
02/01/2023, 15:44 - Sanne: Yeah that sounds good
02/01/2023, 15:45 - Sanne: I have the house to myself and I guess all the wingspan supplies are here anyways? So I offer up my place 💖
02/01/2023, 15:45 - Lieke: My place is also available if needed :)
02/01/2023, 15:45 - Lieke: but I'm also good with biking to yours
02/01/2023, 20:19 - Tim U.: I should've been more clear; tonight is rather inconvenient for me as I'm just making food and still need to work a bit. Friday would be much easier for me
02/01/2023, 20:33 - Sanne: Oh yeah let's do Friday then
03/01/2023, 15:09 - Tim U.: What bouldering time would work for you tomorrow?
03/01/2023, 15:54 - Sanne: If we do 12 maybe Lian can join :)
03/01/2023, 15:57 - Tim U.: That's almost early
03/01/2023, 15:58 - Sanne: We told Lian she could pick the time but not before 12 and then she was like "12 then"
03/01/2023, 16:08 - Tim U.: Oof
03/01/2023, 16:08 - Tim U.: Oh well if it must be
03/01/2023, 16:39 - Sanne: Life be tough sometimes
03/01/2023, 16:40 - Sanne: You can also join a bit later
03/01/2023, 16:47 - Tim U.: I'll check with the other friend I wanted to bring
03/01/2023, 16:51 - Sanne: Yess
04/01/2023, 00:51 - Sanne: There does not seem to be a good way to announce to another person that you left an actual skull in the bathroom 🤷‍♀️
04/01/2023, 01:34 - Tim U.: Did you Miles used to have pre-human skulls lined up on a cupboard above his bed?
04/01/2023, 01:34 - Tim U.: *know
04/01/2023, 09:31 - Sanne: Ahw cute
04/01/2023, 09:31 - Sanne: I bet that made the girls wanna sleep there
04/01/2023, 09:31 - Sanne: It's just the mouse skull for me but that's probably how it starts
04/01/2023, 11:48 - Sanne: I don't seem to be making 12
04/01/2023, 11:48 - Sanne: 😅
04/01/2023, 11:53 - Lieke: Samee😂😂
04/01/2023, 11:53 - Lieke: It wa s raining so we were waiting
04/01/2023, 11:53 - Lieke: Probably more like 12:15 ish
04/01/2023, 11:59 - Tim U.: Good that I was lazy despite going by car
04/01/2023, 12:08 - Tim U.: I'll be extra late due to allergy problems from girlfriend
04/01/2023, 12:15 - Lieke: More like 12:30 🙈
04/01/2023, 12:15 - Lieke: Ooh is she okay?
04/01/2023, 12:16 - Tim U.: Essentially yes but waiting for the meds to kick in
04/01/2023, 12:19 - Sanne: Good luck 💚 hope she feels better soon
04/01/2023, 12:19 - Sanne: I'm on my way now ish
04/01/2023, 12:28 - Lieke: Were also biking now 😂🙈
05/01/2023, 14:39 - Lieke: What time do we feel like bouldering tomorrow, if thats also the plan besides wingspan?
05/01/2023, 14:40 - Tim U.: I don't know yet, might have climbing in the afternoon :s
05/01/2023, 14:41 - Lieke: My plan was to maybe eat at grip again around 17:00 and then boulder afterwards
05/01/2023, 14:43 - Tim U.: Might work out if climbing starts around 3/4
05/01/2023, 14:43 - Lieke: yeah no worries and otherwise ill just join wingspan after i'm done with bouldering (since I would already have eaten there)
05/01/2023, 14:45 - Sanne: Oh you work tomorrow?
05/01/2023, 14:46 - Sanne: I will both go bouldering and climbing today so I'll first see how that goes 🙈
05/01/2023, 14:46 - Sanne: Lex might actually join bouldering tomorrow
05/01/2023, 14:46 - Sanne: Wanna show him our static beta for the pink one
05/01/2023, 15:46 - Lieke: Sadly yes also today haha
05/01/2023, 15:46 - Lieke: Alrighty lets see :)
05/01/2023, 16:02 - Sanne: Tough man
05/01/2023, 17:19 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
05/01/2023, 17:27 - Tim U.: Funny we have that same saying in German
05/01/2023, 17:34 - Sanne: Haha I hadnt heard it before actually
06/01/2023, 13:27 - Sanne: It turns out I'm a lazy piece of shit today so I don't expect I'll develop enough fomo to join bouldering
06/01/2023, 13:27 - Sanne: What time do we wingspan?
06/01/2023, 13:27 - Sanne: (I'll motivate myself to take a bath before then 😅)
06/01/2023, 15:02 - Tim U.: When would bouldering start now? I'm not doing any climbing beforehand after all
06/01/2023, 15:09 - Sanne: I think Lieke was planning to be there around 17
06/01/2023, 16:13 - Lieke: yeah the plan was to go around 17:15 eat something first and then boulder some
06/01/2023, 16:45 - Tim U.: So I'll aim for 17:45 or so?
06/01/2023, 17:47 - Lieke: Yess or 18:00
06/01/2023, 17:47 - Lieke: We almost have our food
06/01/2023, 17:58 - Lieke: We're sitting on one of those couches
06/01/2023, 18:02 - Tim U.: Getting omw now, feel free to start
06/01/2023, 20:16 - Sanne: Hey, will you guys let me know an eta?
06/01/2023, 20:24 - Lieke: 21:00?
06/01/2023, 20:26 - Lieke: Hmm Tim has to eat still 🙈
06/01/2023, 20:36 - Tim U.: More like 21:45😅
06/01/2023, 20:37 - Sanne: Lol
06/01/2023, 20:37 - Sanne: I'll wait patiently ✨
06/01/2023, 21:10 - Sanne: Btw, for when you arrive:
06/01/2023, 21:10 - Sanne: No worries, there has not been a murder
06/01/2023, 21:10 - Sanne: Things may be wet though so watch out
06/01/2023, 21:15 - Tim U.: O.o
06/01/2023, 21:50 - Lieke: My nap hit me hard but omw!
06/01/2023, 21:50 - Lieke: live location shared
06/01/2023, 21:52 - Sanne: Yeah I fully expected 22 by the earliest 😅
06/01/2023, 22:01 - Lieke: Here!
06/01/2023, 22:01 - Tim U.: I'm still eating my last few fries
06/01/2023, 22:04 - Sanne: Ooh fries, nice
06/01/2023, 22:19 - Tim U.: Finally omw
06/01/2023, 22:19 - Tim U.: Feel free to set it up if you haven't already
06/01/2023, 23:27 - Lieke: https://open.spotify.com/socialsession/6h4eFx7MeYCAugmjyoyP8PWBZYzKVOvMb8bxs7mg7ujGQ8Hu2FXMusfNYczVlg2fUoNkIKY68sO6590FPUihopFeLhiIv9CS4pPZ2L3uDc61?si=SB3DCyA5S3yyQjbOLzAmTQ
07/01/2023, 01:52 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
07/01/2023, 01:52 - Lieke: Ooh damnn you played well for me and Lex
07/01/2023, 01:57 - Tim U.: Most of these points are rooted in your earlier setup actually
07/01/2023, 10:37 - Lieke: Oehh so Lex knew what he was doing :P
08/01/2023, 10:18 - Tim U.: Just landed, got a full drug checkup by local security xD
08/01/2023, 10:41 - Sanne: Nice haha
08/01/2023, 10:55 - Tim U.: All the wingspan bags looked like mda to them 😅
08/01/2023, 11:12 - Sanne: Oh hahaha do you think that was it?
08/01/2023, 11:12 - Sanne: That's hilarious
08/01/2023, 11:12 - Sanne: I envision them cracking open an egg being like "what designer drug is this?"
08/01/2023, 11:14 - Tim U.: They probably picked me for inspection because of the bloodshot drug eyes I get from being up early
08/01/2023, 11:27 - Sanne: 😂
08/01/2023, 11:28 - Sanne: I think they also target people that look alternative
08/01/2023, 11:29 - Sanne: Lex once took an exotic looking tote bag to a festival and they were so sure he was there to sell drugs that they were actually super rude to him 😅
08/01/2023, 11:30 - Sanne: So maybe they were like "headband? Why is he not conforming to western fashion? Must be drugs"
08/01/2023, 11:31 - Lieke: Haha ooh damn they eggs do kinda look like drugs 😂
08/01/2023, 11:31 - Lieke: Was is the tiger bag?
08/01/2023, 11:32 - Sanne: No the one mom got in Aruba
08/01/2023, 11:35 - Lieke: Ooh yeah that one is also a vibe
08/01/2023, 11:36 - Sanne: Mhm
08/01/2023, 12:21 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
08/01/2023, 12:30 - Sanne: Ooh pretty ✨
08/01/2023, 12:31 - Sanne: Good place to be
08/01/2023, 12:36 - Sanne: I somehow thought today was a great day to tell mom I'm getting therapy and she hit me with 100km/h of "I don't think it's that bad" "in the Netherlands people get diagnosed way too soon" and "I am tired too, you just need more routine"
08/01/2023, 12:39 - Sanne: Exceeding expections, as ever
08/01/2023, 12:42 - Lieke: Ooh snowww🥺
08/01/2023, 12:42 - Lieke: 👀*
08/01/2023, 12:43 - Lieke: Pfff if I was there I could hit her with the "the gave me PTSD" and then she'll focus on me that my diagnose is bs and that it "wasnt that bad"
08/01/2023, 12:45 - Sanne: Haha yeah I kinda forgot that they don't take you seriously. I was like ah they know Lieke is autistic so maybe it's easier to accept that I could be too
08/01/2023, 12:45 - Sanne: But they still suck! Quel surprise
08/01/2023, 12:46 - Sanne: (Excuse my French)
08/01/2023, 12:50 - Lieke: The weird thing is that I told mom already kinda that you wanted to go and then she didn't have an answer ready to go against it
08/01/2023, 12:50 - Tim U.: I'm on good terms with my parents but wouldn't bring that conversation up either
08/01/2023, 12:51 - Lieke: But mom thinks therapists and psychiatrists are dumb and give you diagnoses too soon or incorrectly
08/01/2023, 12:52 - Lieke: I'm like I had nightmares about dad hitting me and people not believing me where I woke up crying and mom was like "that PTSD diagnosis is bullshit"
08/01/2023, 12:52 - Lieke: Well thanks mom for believing "there is no war in basingse"
08/01/2023, 12:53 - Lieke: But seriously Sanne fuck moms opinion and just don't talk to her about it anymore. I'm your family that believes you and supports you fully ❤️
08/01/2023, 12:57 - Sanne: Thanks Lieke that means a lot ❤️
08/01/2023, 12:58 - Tim U.: I'm up for cozy game session for minor stress relief 🙃
08/01/2023, 12:58 - Sanne: Yeah I was considering to not tell them but I figured it would be weird after you had already mentioned it 🙈
08/01/2023, 12:59 - Sanne: 🥰 you're a sweet
08/01/2023, 12:59 - Sanne: I'll take you up on that soon
08/01/2023, 13:00 - Sanne: May have screwed myself by making lots of plans for the week but most of them are sports so that should help :)
08/01/2023, 13:08 - Tim U.: Also nice 👍🏻
08/01/2023, 13:14 - Lieke: Id just not tell them cause mom has weird opinions
08/01/2023, 13:14 - Lieke: Ooh id be up for that
08/01/2023, 13:17 - Sanne: Myeah I told her I need help and I don't care what lable they give me. I just need one for the insurance. But she was still not really understanding 😅
08/01/2023, 13:23 - Lieke: Mom feels like it's her fault otherwise so she won't accept it 😅
08/01/2023, 16:19 - Sanne: Part of it is though isn't it?
08/01/2023, 16:42 - Lieke: Yess both genes and parenting 💁🏼‍♀️
10/01/2023, 11:09 - Sanne: Oh btw, Lieke and I compared our plannings to look for a stardew opportunity and for this week we only have time after poledancing tonight. So we can do a quicky then or otherwise next week 💖
10/01/2023, 11:10 - Tim U.: Tonight works
10/01/2023, 11:10 - Sanne: 🥰
10/01/2023, 12:53 - Lieke: 👀👀
10/01/2023, 20:34 - Tim U.: https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/1087ke4/my_life_sucks_so_yours_should_too/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=share_button
10/01/2023, 20:34 - Tim U.: Not your situation but the vibe seems similar
10/01/2023, 21:15 - Sanne: Haha yup mom be like that as well
10/01/2023, 21:16 - Sanne: Btw we never settled on a time but I'm home now and I'll have a quick shower and should be ready to game around 22 the latest
10/01/2023, 21:27 - Tim U.: I finally got my second monitor so I'm busy mounting screens vertically atm
10/01/2023, 22:10 - Sanne: Hey we're ready btw
10/01/2023, 22:13 - Tim U.: Yeh my screen is resisting me so unfortunately I need like 10 more min
12/01/2023, 12:08 - Sanne: One of my colleagues had nothing to do and she was nagging about it so someone told her to do 10 push ups 5 reps 😂 he studied to be a sports teacher and it never quite leaves you apparantly
12/01/2023, 12:09 - Sanne: Then I started suggesting modifications to the office like a pull up bar or potentially a moat with bouldering holds so you need sports to go to a meeting or get coffee
12/01/2023, 12:12 - Sanne: Boss isn't going for it though :(
12/01/2023, 12:12 - Lieke: Hahha that be kinda sick. Id want a pullup bar in our door but I can't cause the door it really high and made of glass :(
12/01/2023, 12:22 - Sanne: Ahw sad
12/01/2023, 12:22 - Sanne: Yeah no our doorframe would be perfect
12/01/2023, 12:22 - Sanne: They will demolish the building in a year or so anyways
12/01/2023, 12:22 - Sanne: And the heaters keep breaking so it's a good way to stay warm
12/01/2023, 12:23 - Sanne: I see only benefits
12/01/2023, 12:23 - Sanne: Maybe I'll casually suggest it to the head of stuff. He's weak anyways, he's a people pleaser
12/01/2023, 15:02 - Lieke: Hahaha would be really cool 😂
12/01/2023, 15:26 - Tim U.: An indoor moat sounds wonderfully crude in a luxurious way
12/01/2023, 16:22 - Sanne: Haha I know
12/01/2023, 16:22 - Sanne: Could have little fishies in there
12/01/2023, 16:23 - Sanne: That's a beautiful description
21/01/2023, 18:04 - Lieke: Maybe some gaming tonight?
21/01/2023, 18:11 - Tim U.: Could do, I'm about to go out for groceries so probably not before 8 or so for me
21/01/2023, 18:16 - Lieke: Ooh nicee I'm going to eat takeout at 19:00 the earliest anyways :)
21/01/2023, 18:23 - Sanne: 🥰 gaming
21/01/2023, 20:02 - Sanne: We didn't mean 20 exactly right?
21/01/2023, 20:22 - Tim U.: Nah I only just got back from shopping
21/01/2023, 20:22 - Sanne: Any estimates?
21/01/2023, 20:23 - Sanne: I considered cleaning the house until we start but sssh I'm done 😅
21/01/2023, 20:24 - Lieke: Idk maybe 21;00-21:30 ish?
21/01/2023, 20:24 - Lieke: I also considered cleaning a bit and at 21:10 my laundry is done haha
21/01/2023, 20:29 - Sanne: Nice haha
21/01/2023, 21:56 - Lieke: My pc froze lol
21/01/2023, 22:27 - Tim U.: Uff
24/01/2023, 11:47 - Sanne: Hey! So about us visiting you in Sweden
24/01/2023, 11:47 - Sanne: Is easter a good time?
24/01/2023, 11:51 - Tim U.: Ehh it works I suppose. I think I have regular uni then but most of them that's rather flexible anyway
24/01/2023, 12:20 - Sanne: Oh lol did we mention our brother is coming? 😅
24/01/2023, 12:20 - Sanne: He heard north Sweden and now he's your friend too
24/01/2023, 12:20 - Tim U.: Oh okay
24/01/2023, 12:22 - Sanne: We can still move around a bit with who we'll visit first
24/01/2023, 12:22 - Lieke: Hes me and Sanne but then more quiet 😂
24/01/2023, 12:22 - Tim U.: Curious
24/01/2023, 12:23 - Sanne: And we could amuse ourselves a little bit as well. It's nice if you have time oc but not that we expect 24/7 attention
24/01/2023, 12:23 - Sanne: Haha myeah was gonna say he's us but less annoying and you can talk about nerd stuff with him if you like
24/01/2023, 12:24 - Sanne: If Lieke and I go to the bathroom at the same time you can be like "so computers am I right?"
24/01/2023, 12:28 - Tim U.: Okay xD
24/01/2023, 12:29 - Sanne: I'm low key worried you'll like him better
25/01/2023, 18:08 - Sanne: Btw, does it matter to you if we visit you first or first our cousin? Like the weekend is particularly good or bad for example
25/01/2023, 18:08 - Sanne: Our brother is involved and he haunts us so I expect we will book flights soon
25/01/2023, 18:09 - Sanne: We would be in Sweden from around 7-15 april and then we could do Stockholm first or on the way back from you
25/01/2023, 18:10 - Sanne: We'll also ask the cousin but it's like will she be able to get time off from the job she doesn't have yet? Who knows
25/01/2023, 18:16 - Tim U.: I don't know my uni schedule for April yet anyway so no difference to me
05/02/2023, 18:30 - Lieke: I keep getting Stardew memes on tiktok  😂
05/02/2023, 18:34 - Tim U.: Well I guess we'll have to play again then 👀
05/02/2023, 18:41 - Lieke: Hahaha yeahsss
08/02/2023, 20:53 - Tim U.: So when could that be?
08/02/2023, 20:54 - Sanne: Oh sorry I didn't mean to ignore. Was gonna update but then my brain melted, unfortunate
08/02/2023, 20:56 - Sanne: I'm having a mild breakdown tonight and I think I need to take care of a lot of moving stuff still. But anywhere next week is probably good
08/02/2023, 21:04 - Tim U.: Fair, was just probing
08/02/2023, 21:27 - Sanne: No problem I like a good probe
08/02/2023, 21:31 - Sanne: You guys can suggest a date, I can plan moving activities around that if I have them (probs just be waiting for a floor then)
09/02/2023, 11:05 - Lieke: Hmm maybe we could do Monday?
09/02/2023, 11:08 - Tim U.: Mondays are good
09/02/2023, 11:09 - Lieke: Oehh👀
09/02/2023, 18:28 - Sanne: Yeah I like
11/02/2023, 00:47 - Sanne: Lukas has a drill and he's going to help me make holes in the walls. Apparantly he's very good at screwing
11/02/2023, 00:47 - Sanne: I asked if he'll teach me and say "I'm proud of you child" to make up for some childhood trauma
11/02/2023, 02:00 - Tim U.: Success? 😅
11/02/2023, 09:15 - Sanne: Mhm I have much faith in my journey of finally learning how to use tools
11/02/2023, 13:15 - Lieke: Omg can he say that to me as well?
11/02/2023, 15:34 - Sanne: Haha I can ask if you can join this roleplay
11/02/2023, 15:34 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
13/02/2023, 10:42 - Lieke: Could we maybe do the stardewing early tonight? I'm exhausted after painting Sannes room this weekend and I really need to sleep early for my GMP course tomorrow. I have to do a full day of listening and I need all my energy to power through that with my ADHD brain 😂🙈
13/02/2023, 10:43 - Lieke: My Wednesday or Thursday is also still free so we could also always switch it to one of those days 😋
13/02/2023, 10:51 - Sanne: Same 😂
13/02/2023, 13:02 - Tim U.: Fine by me, what's your early start time?
13/02/2023, 14:48 - Lieke: uhm I was thinking of gaming until 21u?
13/02/2023, 14:49 - Lieke: but if thats too early we can do another night
13/02/2023, 15:55 - Tim U.: That's an end time, not a start time :p
13/02/2023, 15:56 - Lieke: We could also just do it wednesday, then we have more time to game 😁
13/02/2023, 15:57 - Sanne: Haha if you want that then you can suggest that
13/02/2023, 15:57 - Sanne: But rn you are trying to make us decide without giving us all the data
13/02/2023, 15:58 - Sanne: Classic
13/02/2023, 15:58 - Lieke: start time would probably be 18:30
13/02/2023, 15:58 - Lieke: hehehe yets
13/02/2023, 15:58 - Lieke: yes
13/02/2023, 15:58 - Sanne: What do you want? ❤️
13/02/2023, 15:59 - Lieke: ahh idkkkk
13/02/2023, 16:05 - Lieke: I'd be down for stardew 18:30 till 20:30/21:00 ish 🙈
13/02/2023, 16:08 - Sanne: So you're sure you really want to? Or do you think you would disappoint us otherwise?
13/02/2023, 16:10 - Lieke: What are these hard hitting questions 😂
13/02/2023, 16:11 - Sanne: I'm socially managing you of course
13/02/2023, 16:12 - Sanne: I'm too old to hang out with people that secretly don't feel like it (and might ditch last minute) so I'm just making absolutely sure 😘
13/02/2023, 16:14 - Sanne: Lukas inspired me. He told us about his skill to make people cry in public and we were like "what do you tell them?" And he was like "oh well, I simply ask them how they are" but then if he doesnt believe their answer he asks them 6 times until they break down 😂
13/02/2023, 16:16 - Lieke: hahah noo i'm down to play some, is also nice to take my mind of things as well and I enjoy you guys
13/02/2023, 16:16 - Lieke: :)
13/02/2023, 16:17 - Sanne: Cool ❤️❤️
13/02/2023, 16:18 - Sanne: Yeah I was just reminded of you quietly crying in the background that one time 😅 but I believe you 😘❤️
13/02/2023, 16:19 - Lieke: Oh that was not because of you guys that was kinda cause of my roommate 😅
13/02/2023, 16:19 - Lieke: but i'm always at the verge of crying so thats nothing new really
13/02/2023, 16:24 - Sanne: Ahw bby ❤️
13/02/2023, 16:29 - Tim U.: So see you both in ~2h?
13/02/2023, 16:34 - Sanne: Oh wow I didn't realise it was that soon
13/02/2023, 16:34 - Sanne: But yeah, sure
13/02/2023, 16:34 - Sanne: I'm a little behind at work but ssh it's probably fine if I leave it soon
13/02/2023, 18:31 - Tim U.: Hmm my quick shower that started around 17:45 got accidentally detached from time
13/02/2023, 18:32 - Sanne: 😂
13/02/2023, 18:32 - Sanne: Lex is still home so things are a bit slow over here as well
13/02/2023, 18:33 - Tim U.: Maybe I still squeeze in some food then
19/02/2023, 04:59 - Tim U.: https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl/comments/m321b8/egg_irl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=share_button
19/02/2023, 04:59 - Tim U.: We missed a big opportunity with the farm name
19/02/2023, 07:54 - Sanne: 😂
19/02/2023, 07:54 - Sanne: Love that
19/02/2023, 08:50 - Sanne: https://youtu.be/wVYPLP9NSg4
19/02/2023, 08:50 - Sanne: Omg this is literally me at parties
19/02/2023, 13:12 - Lieke: Hahahah ah noo😂😂
19/02/2023, 22:18 - Tim U.: Any estimates for the next gaming session? 👀
20/02/2023, 00:14 - Lieke: Hmm lets see how far me and Sanne get with assembling stuff Tomorrow evening, but we're looking more to like Friday maybe 🙈
20/02/2023, 00:16 - Tim U.: Aight, just checking in on you 🙃
20/02/2023, 05:48 - Lieke: Yeah no worries. Just moving chaos atm but then we're up to some nice and calming stardew 👀🥰
07/03/2023, 16:12 - Sanne: Sooooo
07/03/2023, 16:13 - Sanne: Stardew this week or no?
07/03/2023, 16:13 - Tim U.: I'd be up for it
07/03/2023, 17:43 - Lieke: Yeahss, I could do some tonight after poledancing or somewhere in the weekend like Friday evening. Gonna annoy Lian when she'll come to my place this weekend 😁
07/03/2023, 17:43 - Tim U.: I'll have to be spontaneous about tonight, got some vaguely scheduled calls lined up
07/03/2023, 17:44 - Sanne: Tonight I'm dead 😅 and Friday Jason is making me go to an art thing in Oss
07/03/2023, 17:45 - Sanne: I was hoping like Wednesday or Thursday 😂
07/03/2023, 17:46 - Sanne: Can I interest you in some Wingspan on Wednesday Tim? 🐦✨:)
07/03/2023, 17:47 - Tim U.: Sure, although I'll have to go to bed relatively early
07/03/2023, 18:06 - Sanne: Sounds like that would be responsible for a me too
13/03/2023, 14:16 - Lieke: I'm back mentally again! I'd be down to play some stardewwww. Don't know when you guys have time?
13/03/2023, 14:16 - Tim U.: In the late afternoons / evenings of any day basically
13/03/2023, 14:17 - Lieke: @31620507837 ?
13/03/2023, 14:31 - Sanne: Tonight potentially? I'd wanna sleep early though (Jason kept me up until the last train to Oss and then we fell asleep and he had to stay over anyway 😅)
13/03/2023, 14:31 - Sanne: Or else Thursday
13/03/2023, 14:34 - Sanne: This weekend there's a science film festival and I have all sorts of wild clean up plans so that probably doesn't leave too much time for gaming
13/03/2023, 17:15 - Lieke: What would be your preference?
13/03/2023, 17:55 - Sanne: Ist mir egal ✨
13/03/2023, 17:56 - Sanne: This whole "having time thing" confuses me so I wouldn't mind tonight but Thursday is officially the better option
13/03/2023, 18:25 - Lieke: Let's do Thursday then haha!
13/03/2023, 18:26 - Tim U.: Just realised that in Thursday I have a board game night but they didn't announce the time yet. So I can't tell yet when I'll have time that day😅
13/03/2023, 18:27 - Lieke: Hahaha ahhh planning chaos
13/03/2023, 18:46 - Sanne: We could still do tonight for a bit if that's better?
13/03/2023, 18:47 - Tim U.: I'm flexible on all evenings except for thursday
13/03/2023, 19:21 - Lieke: Should we do tonight then for a bit?
13/03/2023, 19:22 - Lieke: I'm gonna do a quick workout but afterwards I'm down
13/03/2023, 19:24 - Sanne: Sure, let us know when you are ready
13/03/2023, 19:43 - Lieke: you guys can already go play tho :)
13/03/2023, 20:29 - Sanne: I lost my headphones again 😩
13/03/2023, 20:29 - Sanne: Why don't I organise?
13/03/2023, 20:34 - Sanne: Oh they were in a bag, never mind I am super organised
30/03/2023, 19:21 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
30/03/2023, 19:24 - Lieke: HAHAHAH uhmmmm
30/03/2023, 19:24 - Tim U.: the description also just repeats the name & weight like, "we don't need to you tell any more"
30/03/2023, 19:24 - Lieke: and its also in sale!
30/03/2023, 19:25 - Tim U.: Too bad they don't sell those in the 3kg box like some others
30/03/2023, 19:26 - Lieke: 3 kg of jelly pussies?! 😂😂
30/03/2023, 19:27 - Lieke: also 3kg of any candy sounds like a lot stil
30/03/2023, 19:27 - Tim U.: Well I'm already getting 4kg of licorice 🤷‍♂️
30/03/2023, 19:27 - Lieke: hahah damnn I can hear the bloodpressure rising
30/03/2023, 19:27 - Tim U.: It gets very cost-efficient in those amounts
30/03/2023, 19:28 - Tim U.: Don't have to eat them in a week :p
30/03/2023, 19:29 - Lieke: thats alsoo truee
30/03/2023, 19:29 - Tim U.: Speaking of food trading with a hint of horniness, when do we play stardew again?
30/03/2023, 19:29 - Lieke: thats me with buying 4 kg of protein powder
30/03/2023, 19:30 - Lieke: I could maybe do tomorrow night and otherwise mondayyy
30/03/2023, 19:33 - Sanne: Monday sounds good
30/03/2023, 19:33 - Tim U.: Monday night shouldn't be too late for me because of early uni on tuesdays
30/03/2023, 19:33 - Sanne: Omg get pussies for when we visit
30/03/2023, 19:33 - Sanne: Samesies
30/03/2023, 19:34 - Tim U.: Great out of context sentence
30/03/2023, 19:36 - Sanne: ;)
30/03/2023, 20:00 - Sanne: I'm in for any type of pussies
03/04/2023, 12:14 - Sanne: We game tonight right?
03/04/2023, 12:15 - Tim U.: Aye
03/04/2023, 12:16 - Lieke: Yeahss
03/04/2023, 12:17 - Tim U.: What time tho?
03/04/2023, 12:30 - Sanne: Uh start early ish so we can get our 40 blinks tonight?
03/04/2023, 12:30 - Sanne: Like 20?
03/04/2023, 12:33 - Tim U.: Sure
03/04/2023, 13:05 - Lieke: Yess
03/04/2023, 20:07 - Tim U.: Status?
03/04/2023, 20:08 - Sanne: I'm ready enough!
03/04/2023, 20:08 - Sanne: Trying to squeeze in some last minute Swedish practise
03/04/2023, 20:08 - Sanne: Giggling over "hur"
03/04/2023, 20:25 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
09/04/2023, 22:41 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
09/04/2023, 22:42 - Sanne: I did 1 minute and decided that was enough pain and then brother only managed 13 seconds 😂
09/04/2023, 22:42 - Sanne: Lieke did a minute too and a little more
09/04/2023, 22:42 - Sanne: Highlight of the day. I guess we learned as well?
09/04/2023, 22:43 - Tim U.: 13 seconds oof. I guess he isn't joining bouldering? 😅
09/04/2023, 22:46 - Sanne: Haha we'll make him join :) bouldering does suit him a little better than plain hanging
10/04/2023, 09:34 - Sanne: Btw, our flight lands tomorrow at 17:20
10/04/2023, 09:35 - Sanne: Then we dump our stuff at the hotel and we could meet for dinner at your place if you like ✨
10/04/2023, 13:17 - Tim U.: I actually don't have enough utensils to have dinner with 4 people 😅
10/04/2023, 13:46 - Lieke: We'll buy some then 😂
10/04/2023, 13:46 - Sanne: Lol we can get you some spoons from the ikea
10/04/2023, 13:50 - Tim U.: Also the food will be rather limited due to me, unless you wanna cook twice
10/04/2023, 17:17 - Tim U.: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openprimate.llt
10/04/2023, 17:18 - Tim U.: Btw for getting around Luleå is strongly recommend this app for easily buying and activating bus tickets
10/04/2023, 17:29 - Lieke: That won't be a problem, we can adjust to you :)
10/04/2023, 17:29 - Sanne: Thanks! I think we were considering that one already. I am not the brain of this operation
10/04/2023, 17:31 - Sanne: We just think it's gezellig to eat with you ❤️ but we don't have to bother you all the time 😅
11/04/2023, 10:38 - Sanne: Is it just cutlery that you are missing or also cups/plates
11/04/2023, 10:38 - Sanne: We are at ikea now 👀
11/04/2023, 10:52 - Tim U.: Oh you don't need to get anything
11/04/2023, 10:52 - Tim U.: I've planned dinner within the limits of my equipment now
11/04/2023, 10:52 - Lieke: Too late haha
11/04/2023, 10:53 - Lieke: ❤️
11/04/2023, 10:53 - Tim U.: No it's fine really, don't buy extra stuff 🙈
11/04/2023, 10:54 - Tim U.: I just need to mix some bowl / plate sizes and it works out
11/04/2023, 11:25 - Sanne: Well we can always take it home with us 🙈 otherwise you can have many friends over from now on 😅
11/04/2023, 11:25 - Tim U.: Did you already buy stuff now? Cause I do have enough for what we'll be having
11/04/2023, 11:43 - Lieke: 😂😂 uhm yess we gave you a 1 minute window to respond
11/04/2023, 12:06 - Tim U.: Well you get to keep the stuff :p
11/04/2023, 12:09 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
11/04/2023, 13:32 - Sanne: Lol I don't think we know your address actually 😅
11/04/2023, 13:35 - Tim U.: I'm still safe
11/04/2023, 14:01 - Sanne: 😂
11/04/2023, 14:01 - Sanne: We'll find you
11/04/2023, 14:02 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
11/04/2023, 14:03 - Sanne: We can ask around where the weirdo with the headband and the floppy pants lives
11/04/2023, 18:07 - Sanne: So we arrived at the hotel. Did you wanna share your address so we can meet up? 😂
11/04/2023, 18:19 - Tim U.: Hmm I was considering to keep it secret a little longer so I can still do some cleaning
11/04/2023, 18:20 - Sanne: 😂
11/04/2023, 18:20 - Sanne: We are considering to eat at the local pub cause we hungry people
11/04/2023, 18:20 - Tim U.: But realistically you wanna take line 4 all the way to vänortsvägen, that's the closest stop you'll get
11/04/2023, 18:20 - Tim U.: Oh if you're hungry you definitely shouldn't count on me
11/04/2023, 18:21 - Sanne: We could come after food so we are less cranky and you can have a clean home
11/04/2023, 18:21 - Tim U.: My plan to feed this many people was to make lasagne which will take at least 2h with my skills
11/04/2023, 18:21 - Sanne: We will practise surprised compliments
11/04/2023, 18:21 - Sanne: "This is much cleaner than expected"
11/04/2023, 18:21 - Tim U.: This is starting to feel like a family visit, maybe I need to move further away
11/04/2023, 18:21 - Sanne: (We'll add some snide in case your mom is like our mom and you miss her)
11/04/2023, 18:22 - Sanne: We could be hungry again in 2 hours lol. But we could also eat together tomorrow if you decide you'd rather have a simple dinner
11/04/2023, 18:23 - Sanne: We'll pop in for a hug at least ❤️🫂
11/04/2023, 18:24 - Tim U.: Food works for me either way, you should decide how long you want to wait for dinner today
11/04/2023, 18:26 - Lieke: We're gonna eat now and afterwards we'll come to yours 😊
11/04/2023, 18:28 - Tim U.: Aight, let me know when you get on the bus
11/04/2023, 18:30 - Lieke: Will do!
11/04/2023, 20:43 - Sanne: We are now at the bus stop!
11/04/2023, 20:43 - Sanne: But the 4 won't come for another 30 min so we're taking the 5
11/04/2023, 20:44 - Sanne: Maps says we get out at Teknikvägen, that okay?
11/04/2023, 20:45 - Tim U.: Rather get out 1 earlier, Luleå science park. You'd have to walk past that one from teknikvägen anyway
11/04/2023, 20:45 - Tim U.: Do you have an eta?
11/04/2023, 20:45 - Tim U.: I'll pick you up from the stop
11/04/2023, 20:46 - Sanne: 20:57
11/04/2023, 20:47 - Tim U.: Closer than I thought
11/04/2023, 20:48 - Sanne: We are speed
12/04/2023, 10:19 - Lieke: @Sanne let me know when you're in the land of the living again. Me and Jari will amuse ourselves and you can join when ready no pressure ❤️❤️
12/04/2023, 15:18 - Sanne: We started the walk!
12/04/2023, 15:18 - Sanne: It's really pretty 😍
12/04/2023, 15:31 - Tim U.: Nice
12/04/2023, 15:31 - Tim U.: I'm catching up on some household stuff like laundry
12/04/2023, 17:40 - Sanne: I think we're halfway 😂
12/04/2023, 18:18 - Sanne: We escaped!
12/04/2023, 18:18 - Sanne: We're just trying to figure out how to get to you 😅
12/04/2023, 18:20 - Tim U.: Where are you at?
12/04/2023, 18:20 - Sanne: The bus stop at Vänortsvägen
12/04/2023, 18:21 - Tim U.: Oh that's easy then
12/04/2023, 18:21 - Sanne: Lieke thinks she can guide us though if we go to the other bus stop
12/04/2023, 18:21 - Tim U.: Noooo
12/04/2023, 18:21 - Tim U.: Massive detour
12/04/2023, 18:21 - Sanne: Can you send us a location?
12/04/2023, 18:21 - Sanne: Or possible yell very loudly
12/04/2023, 18:22 - Tim U.: Vänortsvägen 84
https://maps.app.goo.gl/RXd45QtqZkXqNc3n6
12/04/2023, 18:22 - Tim U.: Just follow maps to this
12/04/2023, 18:22 - Tim U.: It can do a straight line
12/04/2023, 18:22 - Sanne: Takk❤️
13/04/2023, 00:20 - Tim U.: I assume you got back to the hotel without too much trouble?
13/04/2023, 08:21 - Sanne: Oh yeah we put some _speed_ on and we made the bus :)
13/04/2023, 11:23 - Sanne: We are going to walk on the ice and find a grilling spot for lunch
13/04/2023, 11:23 - Sanne: If you want you can join, otherwise meet at the climbing hall after?
13/04/2023, 11:38 - Tim U.: I just woke up so probably just climbing 🙃
13/04/2023, 12:14 - Sanne: Okido!
13/04/2023, 12:14 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
13/04/2023, 13:03 - Tim U.: Jari looks so satisfied
13/04/2023, 13:11 - Sanne: Mhm he's a happy
13/04/2023, 13:12 - Sanne: We are heading back now and we'll give you an eta once we figure out which bus we can make
13/04/2023, 13:12 - Sanne: Probably gonna take us an hour or so
13/04/2023, 13:32 - Tim U.: Aight
13/04/2023, 14:09 - Sanne: Our bus gets there at 14:22 ✨
13/04/2023, 14:11 - Tim U.: Oh then I gotta go
13/04/2023, 14:12 - Tim U.: You'll be there before me for sure
13/04/2023, 14:16 - Sanne: Yeah that's fine, we'll see ya
13/04/2023, 18:04 - Lieke: We should be there around 18:20 😁
13/04/2023, 18:10 - Tim U.: Oof
13/04/2023, 18:10 - Sanne: That a bad time?
13/04/2023, 18:12 - Tim U.: I just sat down 😅
13/04/2023, 18:17 - Sanne: Down where?
13/04/2023, 18:17 - Tim U.: At home
13/04/2023, 18:18 - Sanne: You're not happy to see us and spend every second of the day with us?
13/04/2023, 18:21 - Tim U.: I realised that I normally spend an hour or so doing essentially nothing after sports, not even food half of the time 🙈
13/04/2023, 21:36 - Tim U.: *Möhrengemüse (veggie stew) recipe*

_Ingredients (1 big girl portion)_
- 500g carrots
- 500g potatoes
- 150g minced meat
- 1 onion
- 100ml creme
- salt & pepper
- various Italian herbs

_Process_
1. Lightly fry onion in the pot with some oil
2. Add chopped carrots on top
3. Add water so that it barely covers the carrots (don't submerge them)
4. Add chopped potatoes and minced meat on top of the carrots (don't stir them together)
5. Set heat to max until the water is boiling, then let it simmer on half heat for at least 20-30min (ideally until most of the water has evaporated but not strictly necessary)
6. Add creme and spices
7. Stir it into a mushy mess

_Tips_
- carrots can be (partially) replaced by parsnips for a sweeter taste profile
- the ratios between ingredients are kinda arbitrary, feel free to adjust to taste
- stab around in the pot during step 5 to make sure the water stays at the bottom
- easily veganised
14/04/2023, 00:15 - Tim U.: I got distracted by a phone call but am now finally counting points
14/04/2023, 00:15 - Tim U.: Jari comes in at a strong 94 points
14/04/2023, 00:19 - Tim U.: Lieke squeezes ahead with 101
14/04/2023, 00:23 - Tim U.: Sanne is flexing her bonus cards with 105 total
14/04/2023, 00:23 - Tim U.: (didn't plan for my counting order to be this dramatic)
14/04/2023, 00:25 - Tim U.: And I'm scraping in at 102
14/04/2023, 00:25 - Tim U.: We all got pretty high scores, probably thanks to focusing on eggs at the end
14/04/2023, 08:47 - Sanne: 🥳
14/04/2023, 08:48 - Sanne: Nice! Good game :)
14/04/2023, 08:48 - Lieke: Pohh so closee
14/04/2023, 08:49 - Sanne: We saw some of the pretty skylights on the way home and then we walked out on the ice a little and now we're tired
14/04/2023, 08:49 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
14/04/2023, 10:33 - Tim U.: Uhh nice
14/04/2023, 15:01 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
14/04/2023, 15:01 - Sanne: Do you see her?
14/04/2023, 15:52 - Tim U.: What is she holding there?
14/04/2023, 16:00 - Sanne: Only three hot dogs 😂
14/04/2023, 18:42 - Sanne: Would you be interested in the rest of our fire making supplies?
14/04/2023, 18:45 - Tim U.: Not really, I already carried a kilo of firewood around during the last few years of my bachelor
14/04/2023, 18:45 - Tim U.: Doesn't come into use much
14/04/2023, 19:08 - Sanne: Ah yeah we have just cubes to light shit with and lucifers
14/04/2023, 19:08 - Sanne: I guess those are sketchy to bring on a plane so we'll probably throw them out then
14/04/2023, 19:10 - Tim U.: yeh probably safer
14/04/2023, 19:46 - Sanne: Btw, we are dinnering now and Lieke and I will come over after for a hug ❤️ that okay?
14/04/2023, 19:47 - Tim U.: Sure, let me know when you get on the way!
14/04/2023, 19:47 - Sanne: Will do ✨
14/04/2023, 20:07 - Lieke: We're planning to be there around 20:35 if that's okay with you?
14/04/2023, 20:07 - Tim U.: aye
14/04/2023, 20:20 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
14/04/2023, 22:47 - Sanne: Ew our bus turned into a party bus 😅
14/04/2023, 22:47 - Sanne: We made it home though ✨
15/04/2023, 00:11 - Tim U.: Good to hear 👍🏻
15/04/2023, 03:19 - Tim U.: Have a safe trip home :) It was fun hanging out with y'all again, thanks for forcing me to go bouldering ^^
15/04/2023, 07:54 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
15/04/2023, 07:54 - Lieke: We had fun hanging out with you too❤️
15/04/2023, 08:03 - Sanne: I thought the bouldering was consensual 😅
15/04/2023, 08:04 - Sanne: But yeah it was nice to see you and where you live :)
15/04/2023, 08:04 - Sanne: Good times 🫂❤️
15/04/2023, 09:10 - Sanne: Aaand we are through security ✨
15/04/2023, 09:19 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
15/04/2023, 13:50 - Tim U.: Did you get a new zippy here or did they let it slide previously?
15/04/2023, 13:51 - Lieke: They let it slide 🥳
15/04/2023, 16:30 - Sanne: We completed our flights and are now on the train home 😍
15/04/2023, 17:12 - Tim U.: 🙌🏻
21/04/2023, 19:47 - Tim U.: Uh oh grip ran out of money on the new climbing gym
21/04/2023, 19:48 - Lieke: Huh really?
21/04/2023, 21:20 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
22/04/2023, 18:12 - Sanne: Damn that really sucks for them
22/04/2023, 18:12 - Sanne: I guess I am never cancelling my membership
22/04/2023, 18:13 - Sanne: I wanna be that rando 60 yo that can still enter both halls
22/04/2023, 18:35 - Tim U.: Good aspirations
23/04/2023, 19:11 - Lieke: Hahah sameesies
30/04/2023, 13:08 - Tim U.: Thank you for the nice card and brush 😊
30/04/2023, 13:09 - Tim U.: Now I'm torn between dual-wielding both my brushes and hiding the new one in my bag due to the label you wrote on it :p
30/04/2023, 13:10 - Lieke: Hahah you're very welcome ❤️
30/04/2023, 13:10 - Lieke: Happy birthday today 🥳🥳
30/04/2023, 13:10 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
30/04/2023, 13:11 - Sanne: Let them think ;)
30/04/2023, 18:47 - Tim U.: Hey, I'm finally trying to plan that trip to Nijmegen in summer. Does the 1st week of June or the 1st week of July work better for you?
30/04/2023, 20:38 - Sanne: Why not both?
30/04/2023, 20:39 - Sanne: No uh, both could do. Maybe light preference for June because it's sooner
30/04/2023, 22:05 - Tim U.: Nice, it's also cheaper
30/04/2023, 23:36 - Sanne: But your love for us is priceless?
01/05/2023, 02:46 - Tim U.: If I had infinite money, sure
01/05/2023, 13:50 - Lieke: yess same hahah
01/05/2023, 13:52 - Lieke: The first week of june i'm not too busy. I have a work weekend with colleagues 8 and 9 june but besides that I have nothing planned yet
01/05/2023, 13:52 - Lieke: Wait are you not our rich daddy?
01/05/2023, 13:53 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
01/05/2023, 13:54 - Tim U.: I make no money 😎
01/05/2023, 14:20 - Sanne: Haha you need your own version of that Kesha song
01/05/2023, 14:22 - Sanne: Buy me a drink I make no money
Don't buy me a drink I drink no drink
Don't call me daddy
01/05/2023, 14:23 - Sanne: It's a work in progress
12/05/2023, 14:06 - Tim U.: Heyo, is there still interest for stardew or are y'all just too busy these days? 🙃
12/05/2023, 14:18 - Sanne: I think Lieke and I don't really align lately 😅
12/05/2023, 14:18 - Sanne: And I am mentally unstable of course
12/05/2023, 14:19 - Sanne: I could probs pop on discord for some wingspan tonight
12/05/2023, 14:19 - Sanne: But on Sunday evening Lieke and I might both be available
12/05/2023, 14:20 - Lieke: If we do it during the weekdays it should work out 😋
12/05/2023, 14:20 - Lieke: Oh yeah same here
12/05/2023, 14:20 - Sanne: No more Sunday for you?
12/05/2023, 14:20 - Sanne: But yeah weekdays are good
12/05/2023, 14:20 - Tim U.: The usual instability or worse than normal?😅
12/05/2023, 14:20 - Sanne: Like monday?
12/05/2023, 14:22 - Sanne: I forgot to file my taxes and I am confronted with having no clue wtf I was doing all year last year with the freelancing. And there's the whole my ex is trans thing that I need to wrap my mind around. So a little extra I would say
12/05/2023, 14:23 - Tim U.: Fair thing
12/05/2023, 14:23 - Sanne: I am flirting with some accountants but they are hard to reach. They tell you they'll call back and then they don't. Is this how dating feels?
12/05/2023, 14:39 - Tim U.: I wouldn't know about either xD
12/05/2023, 15:07 - Sanne: Oh the taxes are fixed!
12/05/2023, 15:08 - Sanne: I didn't even have to pay the accountant. I think it was real flirting after all
12/05/2023, 15:08 - Sanne: He had a super sketch office haha
12/05/2023, 15:15 - Tim U.: Mildy worrisome
12/05/2023, 15:16 - Sanne: It was messier than my room 😂
12/05/2023, 15:16 - Sanne: And it smelled heavily of smoke
12/05/2023, 15:16 - Sanne: But otherwise friendly old man vibes
15/05/2023, 15:53 - Lieke: okayy me and Sanne were thinking stardew thursdayss?
15/05/2023, 15:54 - Tim U.: Works well for me; in the evening I assume?
15/05/2023, 15:59 - Lieke: evening works for me yes :)
15/05/2023, 18:14 - Sanne: We actually get the day off so it could be any point
15/05/2023, 18:15 - Tim U.: Well then let me know when you feel like it
15/05/2023, 18:16 - Sanne: I might have a Jason over because it's a holiday but he is smitten so he'll be content watching me game
15/05/2023, 22:29 - Lieke: I wouldn't mind either. Might squeeze a boulder session in the morning so I still have the full afternoon
18/05/2023, 17:23 - Lieke: okay so how late stardew? Thinking of like 19:30/20:00 ish?
18/05/2023, 17:36 - Tim U.: Sure
18/05/2023, 19:18 - Sanne: More like 20? 🙈
18/05/2023, 19:18 - Lieke: Okayy :)
21/05/2023, 19:24 - Lieke: When stardew againn?
21/05/2023, 19:25 - Tim U.: Good question
21/05/2023, 19:26 - Tim U.: Im currently working on some stuff for uni but can make time for y'all
21/05/2023, 19:27 - Lieke: @31620507837 ?
21/05/2023, 21:39 - Sanne: Hmm I need to check at work tomorrow how godforsaken early I need to get up Tuesday and Wednesday and I start teaching Thursday so it's gonna be a big week 😅
21/05/2023, 21:40 - Sanne: But Thursday evening is definitely an option
21/05/2023, 21:40 - Sanne: If there's more I can let know
21/05/2023, 21:41 - Sanne: And the weekend is festival so that also won't really work I think 🙈
21/05/2023, 21:44 - Tim U.: My project time ends on Tuesday afternoon so after that I'm quite flexible
22/05/2023, 22:17 - Sanne: Yeah I think it will be just Thursday this week for me or Friday after bouldering. Does that work for you Lieke?
22/05/2023, 22:18 - Lieke: oof thursdays i'm going bouldering, but I don't think I'll be bouldering to too late since I'm already going at 18:00
22/05/2023, 22:19 - Lieke: fridays i'm at Lian 😋
22/05/2023, 22:20 - Sanne: Thursday then? ❤️
22/05/2023, 22:20 - Lieke: yess. worst case scenario i'll just join later
23/05/2023, 23:39 - Tim U.: I was mildly curious which type of mayonaise was more profitable and ended up making a detailed spreadsheet xD
23/05/2023, 23:40 - Tim U.: <Media omitted>
23/05/2023, 23:41 - Tim U.: (pigs are there twice bc their truffle finding rate is a bit random, at least 1/day but up to 3/day)
23/05/2023, 23:43 - Tim U.: Imo, biggest plot twist here is the fact that ostriches seem quite good compared to other mayo animals but are actually the 2nd worst in the barn
24/05/2023, 00:17 - Lieke: 😂😂 such extensive research
24/05/2023, 00:41 - Tim U.: Wasn't much to calculate 🤷🏻‍♂️
24/05/2023, 05:19 - Sanne: Spreadsheet about spreads?
24/05/2023, 05:20 - Sanne: I love this haha
24/05/2023, 05:20 - Sanne: Good to know :)
25/05/2023, 19:20 - Sanne: Lieke do you let us know when you have an estimate gaming time?
25/05/2023, 19:20 - Sanne: Then I can nap in preparation
25/05/2023, 19:20 - Lieke: Will probs be between 20:30/21:00 but you guys can already start a bit earlier
25/05/2023, 20:41 - Lieke: 21;00 it is
05/06/2023, 11:43 - Tim U.: I'm here btw, going bouldering at 17 today 👀
05/06/2023, 12:05 - Lieke: omgggg
05/06/2023, 12:05 - Lieke: I was wondering when you'd be here
05/06/2023, 12:05 - Lieke: I'm gonna boulder after dinner at like 18:00/18:30 ish 👀
05/06/2023, 12:07 - Tim U.: Enough time for me to warm up with the other boi that's going
05/06/2023, 12:07 - Lieke: noicee who's joining?
05/06/2023, 12:07 - Tim U.: Don't think you know him, someone from my radboud days who I dragged into bouldering
05/06/2023, 12:07 - Tim U.: Ivo
05/06/2023, 12:07 - Lieke: ooh we (or at least I) have met him once before
05/06/2023, 12:07 - Tim U.: Huh 🤔
05/06/2023, 12:07 - Lieke: blue is renewed this week so I'm very excited!!!
05/06/2023, 12:08 - Tim U.: Uhh nice
05/06/2023, 12:08 - Tim U.: They were all rather slippery when I went on friday
05/06/2023, 12:08 - Lieke: yeah they've been there a while now
05/06/2023, 12:08 - Lieke: but should all be new and fresh now
05/06/2023, 16:00 - Sanne: Ooh I don't know the boi or the new blues so sounds like a good day
05/06/2023, 17:08 - Lieke: It'll be more like 19u ish 🙈
05/06/2023, 17:55 - Sanne: Yeah no same
05/06/2023, 17:56 - Sanne: I am back at the office now and I need to drop laptops in my basement and park the car and reverse that tomorrow 😅
05/06/2023, 19:04 - Sanne: Pff okay I'm on my way!
05/06/2023, 19:04 - Lieke: Almost there :)
05/06/2023, 19:07 - Lieke: Huh red is first new? 😂
05/06/2023, 19:07 - Tim U.: Yup
06/06/2023, 19:53 - Tim U.: Anyone going bouldering tomorrow?
06/06/2023, 19:58 - Sanne: I think Jason is going climbing. And I haven't checked the hall since the new owner so I'd like to. But I probably won't as I have a class to prepare :(
06/06/2023, 20:02 - Tim U.: Aight. I'll probably stick with bouldering since the strippekart doesn't cover both gyms anymore
06/06/2023, 20:04 - Sanne: Ooh right
06/06/2023, 20:04 - Sanne: Silly
06/06/2023, 20:05 - Sanne: Lol will you finish it you reckon?
06/06/2023, 20:05 - Sanne: It's a shame you can't have the abbo for just a month
06/06/2023, 20:07 - Tim U.: Shouldn't be too hard
07/06/2023, 11:33 - Lieke: I'll be going today!!
07/06/2023, 11:33 - Lieke: don't know how late exactly but probably around 18:30 ish or something I think
07/06/2023, 11:48 - Tim U.: Aight
07/06/2023, 12:00 - Tim U.: We have people coming over then so I'll have to go in the afternoon 😬
07/06/2023, 12:42 - Lieke: Ahh sadd
07/06/2023, 12:42 - Lieke: Next time!
07/06/2023, 17:18 - Sanne: Btw, let us know when would be a good Wingspan day
07/06/2023, 17:19 - Sanne: Like nothing wrong with tomorrow 😅 but you can also shout some later days if you are overwhelmed with all the people who wanna see you
07/06/2023, 18:03 - Tim U.: Tomorrow only if you can do afternoon
07/06/2023, 18:13 - Sanne: Nah too bad then
07/06/2023, 18:13 - Sanne: When is your next evening that is weekend for me and not a moment you need for rest ❤️
10/06/2023, 23:26 - Tim U.: Anyone planning to go tomorrow or Monday btw?
11/06/2023, 10:22 - Lieke: Yeeeesss mondayy
12/06/2023, 15:10 - Tim U.: I assume 18 or 19 cause work?
12/06/2023, 15:47 - Lieke: yesss
12/06/2023, 15:47 - Lieke: probably like 19ish
12/06/2023, 15:48 - Lieke: I'll be operating on 3 hours of sleep so I'll be interested to see how it goes 😂
12/06/2023, 16:42 - Sanne: Oh no why?
12/06/2023, 16:43 - Sanne: I think I have to prep my classes so I don't die later this week
12/06/2023, 17:06 - Lieke: I helped Lian with her thesis, her deadline was today at 13u. She didn't sleep last night I gave in at like 4:00 in the morning
12/06/2023, 17:12 - Sanne: Oof that sounds intense
12/06/2023, 18:49 - Lieke: Yeahh im gonna sleep so much Tonight haha
12/06/2023, 18:49 - Lieke: Be looking more like 19:30 🙈

20/06/2023, 15:28 - Tim U.: Fyi, I'm going at 14 tomorrow instead of evening to accommodate a buddy who doesn't go as much
20/06/2023, 15:33 - Lieke: ahh sad life
20/06/2023, 15:33 - Lieke: alsoo Sanne Tim won't join the comp :(
20/06/2023, 15:35 - Tim U.: I put it in the poll :p
20/06/2023, 15:40 - Sanne: Oh noo you break our hearts Tim 💔
20/06/2023, 15:41 - Sanne: What will we do without you in our team?
20/06/2023, 15:41 - Sanne: We need your parental guidance
20/06/2023, 15:54 - Tim U.: Lieke is stronger than me these days, you'll be fine
20/06/2023, 16:44 - Sanne: :( but we like you
20/06/2023, 16:46 - Tim U.: Still going Friday
20/06/2023, 16:47 - Sanne: Yeah I can't make it then 🙈
20/06/2023, 16:47 - Sanne: Nick is throwing a goodbye party and I need to look at his theatre play in Amsterdam
20/06/2023, 16:48 - Tim U.: Uh that's a trip
20/06/2023, 16:48 - Sanne: Which is probably all too well because I need to save power for Saturday
20/06/2023, 16:48 - Sanne: Mhm physical and cultural journey!
20/06/2023, 16:54 - Lieke: I'll bw joining Friday tho 🥰
21/06/2023, 00:39 - Tim U.: It has moved to 16 btw
21/06/2023, 15:23 - Lieke: I'll be there after 19:30 ish 🙈
09/07/2023, 17:19 - Sanne: Yesterday we went on a doggie walk with Kirsten and Carlijn and all the playgrounds in Kirsten's neighbourhood are super nice so I kept running through them yelling "parcour" doing all sorts of irresponsible moves, climbing in the traffic signs
09/07/2023, 17:19 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
09/07/2023, 17:19 - Sanne: And I did not hurt myself even once!
09/07/2023, 17:20 - Sanne: But then today I hurt my ankle on a slab, ffs :(
09/07/2023, 17:20 - Sanne: But I walked it off like a champ, I think it's fine
09/07/2023, 17:21 - Sanne: Just got a google photo reminder of the comp a year ago where I was with my second ankle injury and Lieke got second place
09/07/2023, 17:22 - Sanne: Ankle pain is not the kinda nostalgia I was looking for 😅
09/07/2023, 17:46 - Lieke: Hahaha amazing
09/07/2023, 17:47 - Lieke: Ohnoo :(
09/07/2023, 17:47 - Lieke: How is it going?
09/07/2023, 18:04 - Sanne: It's only a bit annoying when I walk stairs, I don't think it will keep me home at all
09/07/2023, 18:04 - Sanne: Did end the session though :(
09/07/2023, 18:05 - Sanne: Wouldn't dare to ruin my ankle without you there to support me 🫂❤️
09/07/2023, 18:22 - Tim U.: Nice that they have public poles available
09/07/2023, 18:46 - Sanne: Yeah in Nijmegen it's much harder to find a suitable pole friend
09/07/2023, 20:34 - Lieke: Hihi gooood
09/07/2023, 20:34 - Lieke: Hahaha really
09/07/2023, 21:24 - Sanne: Maybe I just haven't tried hard enough
20/07/2023, 18:54 - Sanne: So remember jelly pussies? I offer you the new thing:
20/07/2023, 18:54 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
20/07/2023, 18:55 - Sanne: Okay so they are actually meant to improve sperm taste this time, they're not just fun candy
20/07/2023, 18:56 - Sanne: I told Jason about my B12 deficiancy and he had a very good suggestion for a good source of B12
20/07/2023, 18:56 - Tim U.: Bruh did they do a pilot study to verify the efficacy?
20/07/2023, 18:56 - Tim U.: It's the vitamin tablets right? 🙈
20/07/2023, 18:56 - Sanne: So I did a google search and turns out he's right 😅
20/07/2023, 18:57 - Tim U.: I guess it falls under animal products then 😬
20/07/2023, 18:57 - Sanne: Mhm that's right honey
20/07/2023, 18:58 - Sanne: Well he is being kept under good circumstances
20/07/2023, 18:59 - Sanne: They do have a 5 star review. Seems legit
20/07/2023, 18:59 - Tim U.: Slap one of those EU bio labels on him
20/07/2023, 19:01 - Sanne: Maybe he wants it as a tattoo. Do they change a lot?
20/07/2023, 19:01 - Tim U.: Only in meaning I think
20/07/2023, 19:03 - Sanne: Well I'd have to keep up then. Let him go outside from time to time
20/07/2023, 19:04 - Sanne: Feed him the bio food
20/07/2023, 19:04 - Lieke: So no B12 for me? M
20/07/2023, 19:04 - Lieke: F
20/07/2023, 19:04 - Sanne: Idk, we'd have to google that one
20/07/2023, 19:05 - Tim U.: Y'all aren't even vegan, just get some in your food xD
20/07/2023, 19:06 - Sanne: But Timmy I don't like cheese
20/07/2023, 19:07 - Sanne: Jason says there's dildo's with a cum tube. You could grind up some tablets in there 😂
20/07/2023, 19:10 - Tim U.: Liver and fish contain more anyway :p

08/09/2023, 10:11 - Lieke: This has entered my brain
08/09/2023, 10:13 - Lieke: And I'm quoting "countryloads won't you take my load, on your face down you throaaaaaat"
08/09/2023, 10:13 - Lieke: 🤣🤣🤣
08/09/2023, 10:14 - Lieke: I can't stop listening to it. It tickles my ADHD brain
08/09/2023, 10:14 - Tim U.: Happy to help with music :p

08/09/2023, 11:23 - Lieke: I love that hahah
08/09/2023, 11:54 - Tim U.: This is a more specific mix targeted at a fellow streamer but most of the memes in it are pretty random anyway

https://youtu.be/lhLJEzWORYA?si=rNPgHpubb7GWefsL
08/09/2023, 13:55 - Lieke: 🤣🤣🤣
08/09/2023, 13:59 - Tim U.: Here's another classic

08/09/2023, 17:56 - Tim U.: The sleepover energy is definitely palpable
08/09/2023, 17:57 - Tim U.: Also can't guess her age at all for some reason 🤔
08/09/2023, 18:27 - Lieke: Only that 2 guys are there that keep us in line 🤣

08/09/2023, 18:28 - Tim U.: Ooof

08/09/2023, 19:04 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
08/09/2023, 19:05 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
08/09/2023, 19:05 - Sanne: I'm glad I'm not there 😅
08/09/2023, 19:07 - Lieke: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
08/09/2023, 19:10 - Tim U.: Your workplace seems like a wild place
08/09/2023, 21:14 - Lieke: It's like the Office almost 🤣
08/09/2023, 22:47 - Sanne: 😂 you're right lol
08/09/2023, 22:48 - Sanne: My work feels like that too sometimes but less slapstick though
08/09/2023, 22:48 - Sanne: Omg it's way too hot to boulder 😅 somehow I thought 30 degrees was the right temp to go figure out the blue cave beta
08/09/2023, 22:51 - Tim U.: It's 12° here o.O
08/09/2023, 22:51 - Sanne: When can I come? 😂

11/09/2023, 11:24 - Tim U.: Works for me, how about @31620507837?
11/09/2023, 11:49 - Sanne: Hmm I considered also bouldering but I'm usually not as speedy as Lieke 😅 I'm also dead tired so maybe I'll just stay home and nap instead 🙈
11/09/2023, 11:49 - Sanne: I'm sure I'll manage to join for a bit though for the spice haha
11/09/2023, 11:50 - Sanne: Like the stardew session

12/09/2023, 22:27 - Sanne: Definitively
12/09/2023, 22:27 - Sanne: Also, should you be sharing pictures of Rebecca in her bra?
12/09/2023, 22:28 - Lieke: hahaha you can't see that
12/09/2023, 22:28 - Lieke: its basically less revealing that a bikini
12/09/2023, 22:28 - Lieke: good now?
12/09/2023, 22:28 - Sanne: Like how on earth will I socialise now? "Hey Rebecca, nice bra! How is cheating on your boyfriend treating you?"
12/09/2023, 22:28 - Lieke: sorry Tim too slow
12/09/2023, 22:29 - Sanne: 😂
12/09/2023, 22:29 - Lieke: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/09/2023, 22:29 - Lieke: yeah she's kinda making a mess of stuff
12/09/2023, 22:29 - Lieke: today she was complaining to me about things that are not going well between them and I kinda got stumped on what to say
12/09/2023, 22:30 - Lieke: cause obviously it doesn't click as well as she would like and she sees it better with me
12/09/2023, 22:30 - Lieke: but she is totally staying with him for now??
12/09/2023, 22:30 - Sanne: Haha yeah what the fuck are you supposed to say to that?
12/09/2023, 22:30 - Sanne: You're not involved
12/09/2023, 22:31 - Sanne: "Oh I'm sorry to hear, wanna meet up for coffee so I can give you some neutral advice and a good fingering?"
12/09/2023, 22:31 - Lieke: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/09/2023, 22:31 - Lieke: omg you know too much
12/09/2023, 22:31 - Lieke: Sanneee
12/09/2023, 22:31 - Lieke: I have told mom shit apearently
12/09/2023, 22:31 - Lieke: Hey mom so things you don't know about my life
12/09/2023, 22:32 - Lieke: I broke up with Lian
12/09/2023, 22:32 - Lieke: I may be loosing my job
12/09/2023, 22:32 - Lieke: I'm doubting if doing a master is the right choice (that one may have been for Lian)
12/09/2023, 22:32 - Lieke: I've fallen in love with someone else
12/09/2023, 22:32 - Lieke: and she's in a relationship
12/09/2023, 22:33 - Lieke: I totally have everything under control mom!
12/09/2023, 22:33 - Sanne: 😂
12/09/2023, 22:33 - Sanne: Oh dear
12/09/2023, 22:33 - Sanne: You get a hug from me tomorrow sis ❤️
12/09/2023, 22:33 - Lieke: so I dumped the loosing my job one on her today
12/09/2023, 22:34 - Lieke: <Media omitted>
12/09/2023, 22:34 - Sanne: Yeah good to spread it out
12/09/2023, 22:34 - Tim U.: I'm mildly concerned
12/09/2023, 22:35 - Sanne: I had a real fun talk with mom once that was like "I'm going to quit my job" "I'm signing up for a writing school" "my ex is a woman"
12/09/2023, 22:35 - Lieke: noo it was quit tastefull
12/09/2023, 22:35 - Lieke: wait
12/09/2023, 22:35 - Sanne: It was a picture from the side so it was pretty decent. But I decided it was best to still interfere
12/09/2023, 22:35 - Lieke: I'll spare Tim hahah
12/09/2023, 22:36 - Sanne: Oh she finally realised you're going to school
12/09/2023, 22:36 - Lieke: yep
12/09/2023, 22:37 - Lieke: I'm dreading on what mom is gonna say
12/09/2023, 22:37 - Lieke: I know dad will be all up for my working fully again and for the relationship one he probably also doesnt really care
12/09/2023, 22:37 - Lieke: I think I'll just call dad and let him tell mom hahah
12/09/2023, 22:39 - Tim U.: Wait I thought you started that bc you missed the student life?
12/09/2023, 22:40 - Lieke: I think it also may have been Lian being a student and me having more time like a student that has influenced that decision
12/09/2023, 22:42 - Tim U.: Hmm I see
12/09/2023, 22:43 - Sanne: I guess you just have to sample it and try and be objective about it
12/09/2023, 22:44 - Sanne: No matter the reason, you're there now. Might as well check it out
12/09/2023, 22:44 - Sanne: And who knows, mom might surprise you
12/09/2023, 22:45 - Sanne: My last couple of drastic life changes I dreaded telling her and she was actually quite supportive
12/09/2023, 22:45 - Sanne: She is starting to realise we have to make our own decisions, that work for us. And she feels for us
12/09/2023, 22:45 - Sanne: If not, I'll work on her
12/09/2023, 22:47 - Tim U.: You don't really need their approval for that sort of stuff right?
12/09/2023, 22:48 - Sanne: Nah but they're our parents so it kinda matters. They can still hurt us
12/09/2023, 23:03 - Lieke: Yeahh I'll see, it is what it is 😅
14/09/2023, 18:41 - Sanne: So do we also actually play stardew at one point? 😂 gotta stay ahead of Lieke's sexlife
14/09/2023, 18:47 - Tim U.: I'm here and my self-made mod is even semi functional 👀
14/09/2023, 18:48 - Lieke: Maybe sunday?
14/09/2023, 18:48 - Lieke: Tonight im watching One piece with my fun ex
14/09/2023, 19:08 - Sanne: Yeah sunday sounds good

17/09/2023, 20:03 - Sanne: People don't have classes on Sunday right?

01/10/2023, 15:40 - Lieke: Hahah oh for sure we would be amazing to watch
01/10/2023, 15:55 - Sanne: What should we stream though?
01/10/2023, 15:56 - Lieke: Hmm Stardew could be an option already
01/10/2023, 15:56 - Sanne: Then we need Tim for cringing and asking you to please click on okay so we can start the next day 😂

01/10/2023, 16:03 - Sanne: Well we will have a talent show and people think we are kidding but I shall perform my meme poems and people will be like "thefuck I didn't know your voice could even carry" and they still don't know whether I'm actually talented as a poet or not
01/10/2023, 16:04 - Sanne: Yeah I should also stuff. Bleh

01/02/2024, 13:46 - Sanne: I'm tired but I am beating the stimming by listening to coconuts on repeat
01/02/2024, 13:47 - Lieke: Oooh yeah
01/02/2024, 13:47 - Lieke: Wait
01/02/2024, 13:47 - Tim U.: Instead of singing it yourself?
01/02/2024, 13:47 - Sanne: Conceal don't feel 😂
01/02/2024, 13:47 - Sanne: Yess gotta be appropriate
01/02/2024, 13:47 - Lieke: https://open.spotify.com/album/4rs52z8T5zPbsa5HM75tua?si=6Vcflx0yQZ-ACQ-wAjjpZw&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A4rs52z8T5zPbsa5HM75tua
01/02/2024, 13:48 - Lieke: This album is also the vibe
01/02/2024, 13:48 - Lieke: But i'm afraid that the beats are too much for Sanne
01/02/2024, 13:48 - Lieke: Coconuts has softer beats
01/02/2024, 13:49 - Lieke: But "treat me like a slut" is really good
01/02/2024, 13:51 - Tim U.: "I wanna cum faster" and "I wanna last longer" don't really go together do they?
01/02/2024, 13:59 - Lieke: Yess i love the contradiction
01/02/2024, 13:59 - Lieke: Treat me like a slut. Little dirty bitch, i love to fuck
01/02/2024, 13:59 - Lieke: A great line as well
01/02/2024, 14:03 - Lieke: XXX is also really good
01/02/2024, 14:19 - Sanne: Great art

01/02/2024, 14:37 - Sanne: Seems accurate, if it's my most sung anyway 🤷‍♀️

26/02/2024, 10:17 - Sanne: This might be the worst song ever to exist
26/02/2024, 10:18 - Lieke: Ooh you know nothing yet Sanne 🤣

06/03/2024, 11:13 - Sanne: 🤣
06/03/2024, 11:14 - Sanne: I'm at work I can't laugh this hard they'll think I'm crazy
06/03/2024, 11:15 - Sanne: My poop was fine. Wouldn't say it was significantly different. Maybe a tiny bit thinned out
06/03/2024, 11:16 - Sanne: Are you sure you're okay Lieke? How much diarrhea do you get?
06/03/2024, 11:24 - Lieke: I think it was mostly this
06/03/2024, 11:24 - Lieke: And maybe like 100-200 grams of diarrhea poopoo
06/03/2024, 11:25 - Lieke: Thought you'd appreciate the poop talk 😂
06/03/2024, 11:39 - Sanne: You weighed it?
06/03/2024, 11:39 - Sanne: Not when I'm posing as a professional 🤣
06/03/2024, 11:40 - Sanne: <Media omitted>
06/03/2024, 11:40 - Lieke: No more of a guess or "natte vinger werk"
06/03/2024, 11:40 - Lieke: Was een handje vol
06/03/2024, 11:40 - Sanne: 🤣
06/03/2024, 11:41 - Lieke: <Media omitted>

06/03/2024, 11:45 - Lieke: Hahahah nooo i dont check it
06/03/2024, 11:45 - Lieke: Sometimes i only muffle it but it doesnt catch the poopoo. It does go down
06/03/2024, 11:46 - Lieke: In the toilet 😂🙈
06/03/2024, 11:55 - Sanne: Like you put some toilet paper in the toilet itself?
06/03/2024, 11:55 - Sanne: Or you wrap it around your hand?
06/03/2024, 12:11 - Lieke: Hahah either could work
06/03/2024, 12:11 - Lieke: Depends if the sounds is my poopoo hitting the water or the crackeling of poopoo coming out 🤣
06/03/2024, 12:58 - Sanne: 🤣
06/03/2024, 12:59 - Sanne: Do you shield the sound with your hand?
06/03/2024, 13:05 - Lieke: A lot of toilet paper pressed to the buttcheecks
06/03/2024, 13:20 - Sanne: 🤣🤣🤣

09/03/2024, 21:23 - Lieke: Hahah no mostly lactose intolerant yes and if I eat fatty foods its also bingo
